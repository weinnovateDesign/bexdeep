Recently, I have been very active in [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/)[
](http://www.facebook.com/)with posting and commenting and discussing as well.
There was this post or a topic where we all were discussing. At late night, I
and my friend were chatting on the same topic when suddenly, my friend said,
"Look at the update in facebook."  

  

I went straight there and to my surprise found so many posts and comments
waiting to be read. At that moment I said to myself, how can so many people
post at the similar time and be understood with out any confusion. This took
me into thinking of a problem that usually occurs in the banking sector.

  

When, more then one person try to access the similar account at one time, the
process needs to make sure that no false transaction occur. In technical term
its called [atomicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity).  

  

But the situation here seems a bit different and I was thinking of something
else - the speed of time in the Virtual world. How are we spending our time in
social networking site, and how do we look at these activities ?. In real
world, the interaction happens in a fixed amount of time with certain
constraint and we have a memory of that event as a particular date.

  

But, in virtual world how do it affect our memory which in itself is so
strongly bonded with the speed or the flow of time. Thus, I am exploring
myself into understanding the affect of activities in the social network to
the humans memory and his/her activities in real world.

  

Lets just say, I am still going through the process of analysing it. If you
all come to certain conclusion let me know. It could be lot help for better
understanding of ourselves.
