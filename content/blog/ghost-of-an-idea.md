What nags you in the middle of the night? A nightmare or an idea. While
growing up, I used to be awaken by nightmares and it still does.  
  
Few years back while I was visiting my home, I had to sleep in this old room.
It is located on the ground floor and has a dark passage towards it. The
switch to the lights are on the other side of the floor. My room use to be on
the top floor, now there isn’t any.  
  
I never liked the room, as growing up. It was always dark and cold. I still
remember when I was a kid it use to be my parent's room. My dad would bring
projector from office and show slides on the wall. Photos from his recent
Europe visits and that of his friends. I particularly remember one photo of a
lady in her mid 30s wearing a red dress, she had very red lips. May be it was
then when it all started - the nightmares.  
  
Soon, my dad was transferred to eastern part of the country and we all had to
move along with him. The house was left empty for years and all the belongings
were stored in this room. Once in a while, during our city visit we use to
come to the house, clean it, have noodles at the near-by shop and spend a day.
The area was located far from the city and had a very few settlings. But now,
its one of the booming part of the city.  
  
It was during one particular such visit, I remember entering the room. My
grand mom usually accompanied me, while I went through the old belongings and
toys. That night I had a high fever, my grand mom suspected a demon and she
practised a small ritual trying to free the demon away. Since then, the event
has stayed with me.  
  
So few years back, when I had to spent a night at the room, I was a bit
apprehensive. Anyways, I didn’t take it too seriously. The room also use to be
occupied by my close friend and his family, when they were living with us.
During those times, I had spent many nights at the room. So there I was.  
  
That night, suddenly at the middle of it, I was awoken by a terrifying
nightmare. It was one of those recurring dreams that I always have, since I
was a kid. For me there is one specific dream which has a recursive pattern of
black and white. After that I couldn't sleep the whole night.  
  
It was the ghost of an idea.
