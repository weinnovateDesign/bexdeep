> Ive's team at Apple isn't the usual design ghetto of creativity that exists
> inside most corporations. They work closely and intensely with engineers,
> marketers, and even outside manufacturing contractors in Asia who actually
> build the products. Rather than being simple stylists, they're leading
> innovators in the use of new materials and production processes. The design
> group was able to figure out how to put a layer of clear plastic over the
> white or black core of an iPod, giving it a tremendous depth of texture, and
> still be able to build each unit in just seconds. "Apple innovates in big
> ways and small ways, and if they don't get it right, they innovate again,"
> says frog design founder Hartmut Esslinger, who designed many of the
> original Apple computers for Jobs. "It is the only tech company that does
> this."
