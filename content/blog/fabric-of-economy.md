Had a very interesting thought on the economy. I call it quot;The Fabric of
Economyquot;. Its a basic concept that every human being should have equal
economic opportunity in their life. Hence anyone that tries to distort the
fabric of economy should be penalized. At the core of economy is the
quot;informationquot;. The free availability of information ensures stability
in the economy, as far as I am concern. But there are ways in which
information matters. Each kind of their information has their own priority and
effect on the global economy. What is more important is the stability of the
economy and opportunity rather than arguing the openness of the information.
