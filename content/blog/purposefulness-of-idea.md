Yes, its been a very long time since I have posted anything. And it all boils
down to the "purposefulness of idea". I have not been able to publish anything
because I am not able to find its purpose, its relevance and its place. For me
blogging is more about a conversation and nothing more. And I have not been
able to put up with it.  
  
This is an age of "war of words", where you hardly find any conversations.
Instead, we come across opinionated arguments about right and wrong. I fail to
see the significance of being right and wrong and having an opinion at all.
Simply because, it doesn't matter. My opinion about this world is not going to
change anything, unless I do something about it.  
  
An idea is like a pending task waiting to be assigned to someone who is
responsible enough to execute it. Hence the purposefulness of an idea is
realised when someone decides to do something about it. Most of us are
possessive about our ideas, a result of our false assumption that we own them.  
  
No one owns an idea. It has a life of their own. Like a living organisms, it
strives to exist and spread from one conscious being to another. A truly great
idea is infectious. “Eureka!!! I have got it” is one of the expressions used
when one gets infected by it.  
  
Lets imagine a place, where all the great ideas are locked in. And you get to
dive into it. What do you think will happen? Do you think you will be able to
handle it? A single wonderful idea has the power to carry you to the world of
ecstasy. Hundreds of them would certainly make you unconscious.  
  
So, have I found the purposefulness of an idea? No I have not. But I have
neither found the purpose of not expressing them. Noting down every single
hint of great ideas into a notepad and locking them in a personal vault is an
exhaustive task. But writing about it and letting it go is more satisfying. It
will at least let the idea find its right destination.
