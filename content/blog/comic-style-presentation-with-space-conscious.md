There are lots of technique in which comics are being produced and made. The
traditional printed comics contains the regular flow of the screen-shots of
the story. But once I had seen a video on TED where the comic creator was
talking about the concept of spatial in comics and how the internet could
revolutionize the comic. I think it will take time for such concept to be
widely accepted. As I was going throughnbsp;
http://scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/index.html, it occurred to me that the
slide presentation can be used to create a pseudo space where the story can be
presented. It will depend upon the the use of arrow keys like Up, Down, Front
and Back. But lets see how it goes. The idea is to control the space of the
story through the arrow keys. When you press Front, the space will move front
and when you click Back, the space will move back. Lets see how it will go.
