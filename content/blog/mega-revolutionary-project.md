OK. So two new ideas emerging in my head. 1\. Mythology based on Nepal with
the historical and political touch. 2\. Epic based on current political
stagnancy and forecasting a strong character to take it to the next level and
win the fight. I can see why I am doing this. I think because, I don't see
anyone trying to go to this direction. To set an example. Lets see if I will
be able to pull this off. But need to write a lot to research the topic. One
would be the myths and the other would be the economic aspect. But first I
will have to try the myth.
