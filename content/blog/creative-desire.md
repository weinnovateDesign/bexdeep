One of the difficulty of being creative is not being able to conform with the
surrounding. Almost every thing around you starts to become an extension of
yourself. Every living and non-living things become a part of you and you try
to make sure that it is the part of your conscious extension. An urge which
pushes you to define your surrounding space.  
  
Some people say that Artist is born with an ego which is unsatisfiable. This
ego does not have any rule and boundaries and is very moody in its nature. It
has no value proposition to the society. It simple exist within the realm of
ego of an Artist. You can see the example everywhere in the history of
creativity from Leonardo to modern artists. It is the only think which I have
found that defines an Artist, in a good way.  
  
But this urge to define your space can be a frustrating experience when it
does not conform with your command. I don't know why this urge is so strong
among creative people. It simply doesn't obey the rules and breaks the
boundary of thoughts. It simply stands as the only reason to be living and
this can be very troublesome, sometime. But I think you should never doubt
your creative urges and move along with.  
  
Many creative people living among us has a very hard time fitting into the
realm of life, but I see everyone living for only their extension. Its like
trying to do everything just to save your identity. It may be not the only
helplessness of creative people but also to some extent nature of general
human being.
