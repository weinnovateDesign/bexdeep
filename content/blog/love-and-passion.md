Been a while, I posted anything. So thought of dropping some thing on love and
passion. We all grow up trying to understand what love is and what it  means.
We stumble upon attraction and then slowly grow to understand layers of
emotions and layers of complexity within it.  
  
Then we start pondering upon the existence of True Love. Does it exist? I
remember one of my friend asking me if it really exists like the ones in
stories and movies. Lately, I have come to realize that it certainly does
exist. But not in a sense of a girl and a boy, but more in the perspective of
life.  
  
To understand, we have to see what it means to be in love. I simply think it
is the passion and nothing else. Having a passion is a real thing and not
made-up. People have passion for lot of things and pursue them to eternity. We
have heard of it from our history. Passionate people either changing the
world.  
  
So if you are passionate about something, you are in love with it. Its your
life. So yes True Love does exist. The existence of emotion is real and
authentic. Similarly love between people could also be very real, to identify
it, you simply have to ask if you are passionate - thats all. You are
passionate about something because it makes you feel happy, and gives you a
reason to live on. Some people find their passion in what they do, some people
find passion in some other people.  
  
Passion is the foundation of love.
