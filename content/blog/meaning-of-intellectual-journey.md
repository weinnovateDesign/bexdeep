What is the idea behind intellectual journey? One thing I am sure of is that
its not about being able to quote Socrates or Aristotle. Neither it is about
merging yourself into the ocean of books and understanding what others have to
say about the world or life.  
  
Instead, I believe its the exact opposite. Its about stripping yourself from
all the ornamental moral values and knowledge you have gathered for years and
starting from scratch. It is a journey you take with a blank canvas and paint
it with NOT your knowledge but with your experience. Its about being honest
about yourself.  
  
History provides us with numerous examples where great thinkers have taken
that path and emerged out with enlightened conscious mind. The goal of
intellectual journey is not to find out truth but to get rid of all the lies
that you have been holding on to.
