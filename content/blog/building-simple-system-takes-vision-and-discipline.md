Almost every entrepreneurs are building something today. From a mobile
application to hardware systems to simple services. But the key challenges is
always getting users to adopt them. This brings to an interesting field of
product development which is off-course understanding your users.  
  
Understanding users doesn't require any technical understanding of the system
but instead requires more in-depth understanding of human senses and how they
react. May be this is why today, the term "design" can be seen overused over
the literature and talked about in conferences. I believe people use it often
to catch eyeballs.

But I think that design is a core discipline of an engineer which is being
taught but not stressed upon. The fundamental of control system is about
creating efficient system that works better and that can be used better.  
  
The excerpt below is taken from a [blog post
](http://crmweblog.crmmastery.com/2010/11/building-simple%C2%A0enterprise-
software/)that essentially talks about making simple to use enterprise
software. It is an interesting one. If you find it useful, you should check
out the original post [here](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/07/building-the-
simple-enterprise/).
