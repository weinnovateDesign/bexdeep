In an analytics field or any other field, there is always a problem. A
particular thing that you want to achieve. May be you want your sales to rise
by 50% or exactly 2.5% or you may want to build a house on an ocean! Daunting
as it looks, but that is the nature of the problem.  

  

How do you go on solving it? I mean any problem or analysis? How do you do it?
Obviously, you have to design a solution. I take solution as a design that has
the potential to solve a problem. When you start designing for a solution, you
start by constructing a structure of a foundation on which you are going to
build your reasoning. Your whole reasoning will be based upon that foundation,
that structure. If it is stable then your analysis or the whole system is
stable otherwise, it will fall and that is inevitable.

  

Also, remember that the solution that you provide is going to be valid only
for that particular problem and not other, because as soon as the situation
changes so does the validity of you solution. Remember it.

  

  

It was the other night that I had a discussion with my friend on the
complexity and the simplicity of a design or a solution. We both came to a
conclusion that a particular design is the special purpose system and NOT
general purpose.

Also, in case of the level of the complexity and simplicity. The more complex
is the system the more rigid it becomes and won't be able to handle the small
disturbance. But when the system is simple then, it has a capability to grow
and has more flexibility in it.

  

  

But, this is not a proof that the solution must always be simple, what is the
conclusion is that the analyst or a designer must have this in his mind that
complexity has an inbuilt error of approximation which must be considered. The
complex mathematical solutions are based mainly upon the [mathematical
reality](http://mikeschuler.web.aplus.net/id36.html) which may not be always
true which imposing it in the physical model.
