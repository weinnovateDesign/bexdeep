During those moments of Silence,  
and those moments of pain,  
I (long pause) remembered U.  
  
While the darkness was around the corner,  
and my shadow was still clear,  
I remembered U.  
  
During the conflict of morality,  
and the confusion of crowd,  
I remembered U.  
  
As the sun rose high,  
and I opened my eye,  
I remembered U.  
  
As I was listening to JM,  
and playing his rythm,  
I remembered U.  
  
As I was walking alone,  
holding on to my dreams,  
I remembered U.  
  
U didn't come from my past,  
neither from my present,  
but I remembered U.
