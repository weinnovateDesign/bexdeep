Yes, the title itself says much about the application it self. Twitter, what
can I say? Its a whole world shouting at an instance. Some are buying
groceries, some are at bathroom, some are sleeping in the class, some watching
movies, and so many things that its just amazing to listen to them. Wait!!
there are bots too, some are very useful bots who brings great information but
some are hopeless and irritating.  

  

In this chaos of information, we need a perfect client application to mine
through these information and at the same time allow you to grow your
relationship with the people and grow in the network. As per the need, we felt
that we must come out with our own client application and here is the first
alpha version, which you can [download](http://www.buzzom.com/buzzomlab) for
free and use free.  
  
_1\. Hide users who are spamming with too many or useless tweets without
unfollowing them.  
2\. Get updates on what the twitter elites like GuyKawasaki, BBC etc. are
saying without following them.  
3\. Configure your buddy list and be in touch with them by viewing only their
tweets.  
4\. Find news and people using keyword Search for tweets, location and
biography.  
5\. Auto shorten your long URLs when they're sent using http://nxy.in.  
6\. Drag-drop video and pictures to auto upload and tweet about them.  
7\. Choose how you want to see your tweets, by auto refresh or manual
refresh._
