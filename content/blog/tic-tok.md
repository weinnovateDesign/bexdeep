I didn’t do anything,

I just sat there,

keeping silent,

eyes closed,

heart beating,

mind wandering,

long breathing,

in and out,

just breathing,

just waiting,

for nothing.

  

I just didn’t do anything.

I just sat there,

holding down the tears,

listening to tic tok,

tic tok

just listening,

just waiting,

for nothing.

  

when i opened my eyes,

tears rolled down,

mind went numb,

heart stopped,

no more tic tok

i had lost it

i realised

I whispered to myself

i had lost it

took long deep breath

and just sat there.

just waiting

for nothing.
