Team management and collaboration is something that management and project
leaders spends their whole time thinking about. The challenges is always about
making every one perform to their optimum and at the same time improve the
efficiency of the team. There are many thoughts regarding the team
collaboration and management.

But one notion that everyone in the team needs to have equal efficiency and
ability to work as a team is an interesting and contradictory one. Because its
not always true. In a team every one can put their own effort in their way and
help the overall team to move forward. There is no such thing like important
entity of the team or important person, every one has their own importance and
space in the team work.

  
Just like a engine, every part has their importance and even failure of the
smallest component can result in a disaster. Therefore, the idea that every
gears need to be round is in a way illusion. If all were round than it could
be beautiful but the reality simply doesn't allow that to happen.  
  
So I stumbled upon this wonderful video on weird gears which demonstrates
strongly how a different kinds of shapes of gears can be coordinated to allow
efficient running. Remember that the coordination in gears are irrelevant to
shape of gears but the coordination of the teeth of the gears. Similarly, team
is not about efficiency and ability of the individuals but the coordination of
them  
  
Enjoy the video
