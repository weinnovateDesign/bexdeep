If there is any fictional character that I take seriously, than its no other
than Sherlock Holmes. I was glad to have read his stories at a very early age.
There is so much to say about this amazing consulting detective, through whom
I have learnt a great deal about the _Art of Problem Solving_.  
  
During my adventure with the stories of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. James Watson,
I came across a **real** **character** who had a tremendous influence on me -
**Jeremy Brett**. Though I have watched other actors portray the legendary
Sherlock Holmes. I must say there was no one better than Jeremy Brett.  
  
Though, many might argue with me for many reasons, I stay by my words. I have
no rights to compare another legendary actor Peter Cushing with Jeremy Brett.
But, I stumbled upon two videos which makes a perfect case for me to point out
the energy and the passion Brett brought to the scene.  
  
Below are the two scenes from a same story - **The Blue Carbancle**. The story
is superb and has many elements to it that makes the scenes below an important
one.  
  
[![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/en/a/ac/SH_BLUE-01.png)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/en/a/ac/SH_BLUE-01.png)The
scene includes an important statement being made by Holmes. When Holmes asks
Watson to examine the hat, Watson queries about the hat. And Holmes says
laughingly,_"Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen
when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the
space of a few square miles."_  
  
The statement below is not included in the TV adaption : _[Amid the action and
reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events
may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented
which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had
experience of such.]_  
  
Now, the statement is certainly one of its kinds. Its long and complicated but
has deeper philosophical meanings to it. Now watch how both of the actors
deliver them and you will understand my point. In the second video, its better
to start from **3:40.**
