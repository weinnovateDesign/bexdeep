In this age of information, graphic design has a very important role to play.
It is the medium through which we perceive information. Hence, we find many
materials regarding design and design thinking scattered around in the
internet. I must say, design is one of the top topic which is always discussed
in social networking sites like Twitter. And I myself, follow those
discussions ardently.

There is one site called
**_[designobserver](http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=8217)_**
where many designers express their thoughts on the design philosophy. ** **  
  
**Adrian Shaughnessy** is a graphic designer and writer based in London. In
1989 he co-founded the design company Intro. He has written this wonderful
paradoxes about Graphic Design that people usually relate with.  
  
I will list the 10 points here, for full read **[click
here](http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=8217)**.  
  

_**01:** There’s no such thing as bad clients: only bad designers. _

_**02:** The best way to learn how to become a better graphic designer is to
become a client. _

_**03:** If we want to educate our clients about design, we must first educate
ourselves about our clients. _

_**04:** If we want to make money as a graphic designer, we must concentrate
on the work — not the money. _

_**05:** For designers, verbal skills are as important as visual skills. _

_**06:** Ideas usually fail not because they're bad ideas, but because they're
badly presented. _

_**07:** “I’m a professional: I know best_

 _**08:** “All the good jobs go to other designers.” _

_**09:** The best way to run a studio is to be domineering and forceful. _

_**10:** If we believe in nothing, we shouldn’t wonder why no one believes in
us_
