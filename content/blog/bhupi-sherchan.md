the dark road of life,  
I feel success is  
like a lamp lit by the dynamo of a bicycle.  
So long as  
my legs rise and fall,  
pushing the pedals,  
the lamp lits the path ahead of me.  
But as soon as I tire,  
and my feet slows to a halt,  
in front of me jumps

darkness barking.

______________________________________________________________

The original poem is written in Nepali.

  

I rarely read poems and sit, though I sometime write here and there. But when
I picked up the collection of Bhupi Sherchan's poems, I was completely taken
in by his writings. I could hardly believe what I was reading. I never knew
that his poems were so rich and so realistic.

  

It was not the rhymes nor the rhythm, but by the sear truth of it. I could not
stop reading more. The more I read the more I became aware of Bhupi's world
and the world it was during his time. Most satirical with himself and the
world around him, he has written one of the finest poem's in Nepal's history.
I would rather say it was his observation and his understanding of human
nature, the society and the life, which is most amazing.

  

I really don't want to explain the poem, just read it and see how true he is
in his observation about success. On my perspective, success is a never ending
state, its not the peak where you reach and feel safe. Instead its an on going
process and the moment you stop, so does the success.

  

I would like to know how you all felt about it.
