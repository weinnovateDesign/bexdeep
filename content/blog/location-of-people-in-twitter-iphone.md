[](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_UYUaEitRq54/ScjLspUfRhI/AAAAAAAAAkk/CEOinx_zoqI/s1600-h/tweet.jpg)Recently,
I was working on the data of the twitter. I did one interesting and quite
simple thing. I took the list of the location people were using in there
profile and fed it to one of the available online tool called
(<http://www.wordle.net/>). Guess what I got? I found that majority of people
on twitter seem to be using iPhone. May be it was obvious, but to see it
through data was quite a taste. The size of the population used is 31691.
