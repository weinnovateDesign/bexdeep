The Democratic Voting is a statistical fallacy. Why? Let me come to my point,
why is the concept that majority wins followed everywhere. Where in the
statistic does it tell that the majority is always the correct. According to
mathematics, majority only shows the likeliness of the people to choose that
particular person. But nowhere does it say that it is the correct one.  
  
Therefore, should majority be followed even if it is known that the choice is
WRONG. What is the justification for it? Or has anyone even tried to justify
it? Is this the natural law that must be followed blindly?  
  
History have shown us how a single person have fought against the majority.
Starting from all the scientists to leaders. Should the truth always remain
fighting against the majority. Is that how it is, and should be? Can't we
adapt our senses to bring the right choice rather than a major choices?  
  
May be its the survival of the fittest, where the more stronger in number
always wins. Right choice are always smudged by the majority. Every year we
see the election process go on and on , and the mistakes seem to repeat
itself. Very rarely does it happen that the right choices are made and even
that happen as an alternative choice or a choice due to helplessness.  
  
Most people can't differentiate between right and wrong. Haven't we learnt
enough from the reality TV shows where the winner is not always the best.
Isn't that the most visible truth of why majority or democratic voting fails.  
  
Further democratic voting is never so democratic. Democratic means decision
made from unbiased analysis. Do you think that happens? Often people make
decision based upon others choice and not their own. They feel insecure doing
free thinking.  
  
Thus I say Democratic Voting is a failed system. We need something else to
determine not the popular choice but the right choice.
