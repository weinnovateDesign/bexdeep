Learning to fight and trying to live for your own sake,  
  
in this crazy world, finding inspiration is hard.  
  
But in the midst of many heros and characters,  
  
Steve genuienly stood as the ONE for me.  
  
More than anything, it was his perspective and understanding of the world,  
  
which I have come to respect over time.  
  
I believe inspiration never dies,  
  
it lives on.  
  
RIP Steve.
