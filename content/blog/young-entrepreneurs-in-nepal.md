Among the midst of the political turmoil and its entertaining melodrama, its
difficult for any serious young innovators to work their vision out. With the
deadlock in the western economic situation and there overwhelming influence in
the developing nation, ultimately it comes to us - the young minds to stand
against them.

  

I have seen the rising entrepreneurs in
[Nepal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal), especially [Kathmandu
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu)in this span of 1 year. Last time, I
remember me and few friends trying to share in a platform that was not
entirely focused on young innovation. Well these kinds of things usually lead
to expected over look on the ideas. But now the situation is quite reverse.
Today there are not only handful of young innovators but network of them, with
serious attitude to change the attitude towards better future.

Today is the start of such beginning -
[BarCampKTM](http://barcampktm.wikispot.org/Welcome?action=show&redirect=Front+Page).
The concept of BarCamp is to come together from different walk of interest and
share your passion among others. Do not be mistaken for the field to be narrow
or any particular, its an open invitations for ideas which will get a place to
foster to a tactical actions.

  

Though I am far from [KTM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu), I still
would be making an effort to follow it through Twitter,
[@barcampktm](http://twitter.com/barcampktm). (unless it crash like it has
been lately) I hope every Nepali young minds make some effort to bring this
change where things are govern by the sole passion of young entrepreneurs and
innovators.
