As a child or as a conscious being, we all look in amazement towards the life
that we live. With questions filling our thoughts, we try to solve each one.
Be it a scientist or an ardent thinker or any normal being. We all are
conscious of the fact that we exist and that it is only for some time.  

  

Within these time, we struggle to understand ourselves and the world around
us. We try hard to unravel each mysteries. But as we go along, few stop asking
and few stop ignoring and few just become silent.

  

But during all these questioning and answering, we can't ignore the fact that
knowing brings a satisfaction to us. Knowing things makes us feel happy and it
makes you feel good because suddenly you are out of the state of confusion.
This we call an enlightenment.

  

That instant when we discover something, for that very few seconds of our
life, we become so clear in our thoughts. We feel blessed. Yes, we do and such
is the beauty of knowing which can never be replaced.
