We all have certain notions about knowledge and wisdom. We feel we have
understood them, through text books and holy books. But are we sure?  
  
Knowledge is like energy which can flow between two beings, similar to how
energy flows between objects. This transfer of energy changes the state of an
object, just like knowledge changes the state of mind. But the key driver of
this change in state is not the amount of energy.  
  
The structure of an object is the one that is responsible for the way it
reacts to the energy flow. Similarly, attaining the state of wisdom is not the
result of the amount of knowledge you have gathered, but is the result of the
nature of your being.  
  
Hence, knowledge can be transferred but not the wisdom because wisdom is not
something you have, its something that you have become. Wisdom is something
that you have transformed into, as a result of knowledge and the process of
your conscious mind.  
  
So if you can control the nature of your being, you would not need to pursue
for more knowledge. Rather, you can reach the state of wisdom, with whatever
little you have. The strength of a tree is not measured by the number of
branches and fruits it has, but by the depth to which its roots are spread.
