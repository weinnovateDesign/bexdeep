With his closed eyes,  
and calm composure,  
there he is disillusioned by his own conscience.  
  
The state of enlightenment,  
which he pretends to have,  
is haunted by his own existence.  
  
Like a glowing candle,  
he is caught in a conflict of  
spreading a light and a desire to exist.  
  
Like a shapeless form and an unheard sound,  
he is trapped in his own reasoning.  
  
Though he pretends to be a hermit,  
underneath lies his hidden desire to exist.
