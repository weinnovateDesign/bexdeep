What if you could capture your every voice and your every status of mind? For
example, everyday, we talk and think of different ideas. Wouldn't it be
interesting to- you know - go through them at some time in your life, like a
movie or something. Many concepts regarding recording your life has been
portraited in the Hollywood screens.

  

We are continuously expressing ourselves, and all that is being permeated in
this universe. Some how if we could capture each individuals voice it would be
very interesting. Today, it just occurred to me that, may be we have such
things in our service.

  

I was going through my old Twitter Post and Facebook Post, somehow I could
feel my presence on it. Every thing being written on the blog or posted in
Twitter and Facebook, is my voice, isn't it? All the comments on my friends'
photo are the conversation between my friends which has been captured. All our
characteristics have been imprinted on it. As if, we are living on it.

  

I know these are the obvious thoughts that come and go on each individuals
mind. I just thought of sharing it. Yes, I am capturing my Voice.
