It was the year 1992, as far as I remember. I use to stay with my grandmother
and grandfather, away from home. I would hang around with my mama (mother's
brother) when ever he was free. He was in many ways, my early influence in
many facet of my life : music, movies, clothes and what not :) Most of my
early influence of music comes from his collection.

**Imagine** was the song which use to play in loop in his stereo player. I was
slowly observing the music in background, which would slowly reveal itself in
future. Somehow, the song **Imagine** and **Tears in Heaven** , always had be
baffled. It was after many years, I would finally recognize the difference in
the song. John Lennon was not even in the picture.

Then it was the year 1998, in my teen age, I finally carried away the
collection of the cassette from my grand mom's house and brought it to my
house. Now, I had my own room, my own walkman and my own fantasy of life.
After hours of dusting out the cassettes and excitedly peering into the
collection, I picked up the one with a faint impression of a label written
with blue chinese pen - the Beatles. That was the beginning and have never
ended till now.

Each of the characters : John, Paul, George and Ringo have made  a place in my
little dream house. Now, they have become more than just a mere music
personalities but a philosophy for me. People have their concerns about the
break-ups of the band and the tension between them. But I see them as 4 unique
individual who for some period of time, came together for a purpose in this
world.

My last thought :

> _Paul is about love,
> and John is about rebel,
> George is about life,
> and Ringo a beautiful rhythm_
