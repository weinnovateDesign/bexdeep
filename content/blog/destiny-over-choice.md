I think I was born to be an Industrial designer. How do I know? I don't, but I
just feel it that way though I am not, yet. In similar ways I could say, I was
even born to be an Entrepreneur. But ironically, I never knew about these
fields until few years back. This happened cause I stopped the speeding clock
of my life. I took off from a steady pitch road started venturing into no
man's land. I feel glad that I did.  
  
Everyone is not born with an opportunity to know it all before hand. And not
every society has a condition where one can find their destiny. So, I feel
glad that I was able to find my dream. To find a thing where you could give
all your life, its like finding a love of your life.  
  
My understanding of myself begins with a realization of my interests and my
choices. Irrespective of what you have been doing so far, you need to be sure
of your likes and dislikes. It takes an immense effort for anyone to choose
their choice, I am not able to know why? A wise person have told that you are
defined by things that you don't do. There is an immense noise in today's
world blocking one from figuring out clearly on what they want to do and don't
want to do.  
  
World is certainly a very noisy place and getting through it is the most
difficult task of all. From the very beginning, we are told about the right
and wrong, and about our moral values, only to be proven wrong latter when the
reality hits you hard. Finding factual and authentic information has become
difficult with time.  
  
The satisfaction that you receive after reading a good book or watching a good
movie or listening to a good music is unparalleled to anything, why? Because
no matter what people say and no matter what critics say, good thing always
matters. Good thing are never justified, they are just accepted and lived. You
find yourself blessed to have found your passion.  
  
So, I am still questioning over this conundrum, the choice of destiny over
choice. There is a big difference between flowing along the current of a river
and walking against it.
