So some really long time ago. Around 6 years back when I was in my college I
wrote this novel based on an interesting and life-changing trekking trip which
me and my friends took. Those 15 days of trip was unforgettable and has
remained among my friends as an EXPERIENCE.  
  
Now after many years, I think I can share this story which I shared only among
few friends. The story is pure work of fiction but among friends it has some
recognisable elements.  
  
The story is title THE NOVEL as at that time I really had no intent of sharing
with anyone else. Further, I had promised my friends during the trip that I
would write a novel on it and so the name THE NOVEL.  
  
Hope you will enjoy reading though it was written long back on a very rough
english :).  
  
Here is one of the section of story:  
  
_" From the middle of this dark canvas, a bright yellow light was beaming from
the window of one of the hut. A dark figure was moving up and down. After a
while, it slowly settled down and a slow whispering sound permeated through
the icy cold air. “I think it has stopped raining,” spoke a thin female voice.
After a little silence, the male voice mumbled, “it’s not the rain that I
fear.”_
