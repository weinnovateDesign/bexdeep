sometime you stumble upon a word that you don't know. Soon the sentences
doesn't make any sense, so you ponder upon the meanings of words. Reluctantly
and lazily, you open a huge dictionary, though very uncommon now a days, and
start searching for the word. Time passes by but you are still stuck with your
dictionary. You are already learning many words but not the one you were
searching for.  
  
What is this phenomenon? The phenomenon of getting lost into your own world.
But some people are so focused that they find what they are searching for and
soon return to their work. But some, like me, get lost and starts stumbling
upon more unknown words. The mystery engulfs the mind and soon you are lost.
But, yes ultimately you do find the word you are searching for and then return
back to your work.  
  
I find life so similar to opening a dictionary. You are confused and lost and
try to find the meaning by opening your horizon and soon get lost into
millions of issues. You stand there looking at each of it and pondering. You
take your time and roll your views and thoughts here and there, questioning
each reasoning before finally finding what you came to find for, and returning
with more than what you asked for. Life is that way, I think.  
  
Getting lost. Just like opening a Dictionary..... I don't know what I was
searching for before I started writing this post. may be I must return to what
I was searching for.
