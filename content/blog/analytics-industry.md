The chart above shows that the 90% of the analytics company is from USA and 6
% from U.K. Whereas India covers only 1 % of the total analytic industry.

This shows that Singapore, India and Australia are very low with respect to
the western counterpart. China is not even in the category. Overall, US has
the majority of the share.

  

Analytics in itself is not an industry, it can associate itself with any data
intensive industry. Lets look at the industries where analytics is applied.

The above table clearly shows that the major players of analytics are related
to the Business Services. Then there are Software & Internet, Health care,
Consumer Services, Retail and Financial Services.

  

  

Most of the fields like Telecommunication still seems to be unexplored
properly. But I assume that with the increase in the telecommunication sector,
in near future we might see increasing use of analytics in the those fields
too.

  

  

  

Now lets move on to the range of the employees in these analytics industry.
The table and the graph shows that the average of employee is around 1 - 100
range. But in some it could increase beyond 100K. This is a great contrast.

Now lets look at the revenue range of these company. The majority of them have
a revenue of around $0-10Millions. The distribution of the employee range and
the revenue range seems to be correlated with each other. It might also
suggest that for a company to increase their revenue it needs to increase its
infrastructure and grow big.

All these details on the analytics company shows that the industry is growing
and that its penetration is still low in the eastern region of the world.
Industry wise, there are many sector which still have not employed analytics
as the part of their solution.

  

Being an analyst and related to analytics field, I would consider the
importance of the field is increasing with the rise of information age, where
there are millions and millions of data uncovered and unexplored. With so many
data floating all around us:

  

Data for Analyst is as Gold is to Miners.

  

I hope above presentation was useful.
