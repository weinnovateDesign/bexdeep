so.. here goes the "Proximity of Life" story told through maps.. i know...
maps.. this morning.. somehw.. i got myself glued on maps and i started
marking stories on it. frm place i was born to place i went to school..where i
got my degrees and it was amazing how each stories took place in close
proximity...... its hard to look into the future.. but i am sure.. maps is
going to be a next place where we might be spending more of our time..
exploring places and new stories ... so here i am publicly sharing stories
which took place at different location in the map.. the idea is the more u
explore this map.. the more interesting stories u will stumble upon.. just
image.. if we layer each of these storiess.. the map we create would be full
of life...  
  
So yupe.. hope u enjoy few stories which i hv share.. feel free to share.. and
like :)
