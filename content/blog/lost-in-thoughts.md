When you are on your own, living a life and there is no one to scold you or
guide you, you tend to lose every patience and every strength in you. And its
obvious, especially, when there is no binding in the thoughts and you are free
to think.  

  

Its sometime difficult to make sense of everything, and then just conclude
that nothing makes sense.

  

I believe, in such case, we need to be strong and fight with our emotion and
find reason to do something in life.

  

There is no reason for a clay to be moulded to a statue but trying to give it
some shape is what we try to do. Though both may make no sense.

  

War and Peace. Can you imagine a place with no war? I doubt it. Its difficult,
an extremely difficult situation. But can you imagine a world in mayhem, YES
we can, its so easy. Destruction is so easy. But creation and stability is so
hard. If we let the destruction overwhelm us than the society will go down.

  

Remember we all are just trying to create a harmony and exist. We are trying
to bring balance and avoid complete break down of our society.
