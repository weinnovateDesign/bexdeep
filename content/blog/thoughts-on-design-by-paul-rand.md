I haven’t changed my mind about modernism from the first day I ever did it….
It means integrity; it means honesty; it means the absence of sentimentality
and the absence of nostalgia; it means simplicity; it means clarity. That’s
what modernism means to me…  
  
_— Lecture, A Paul Rand Retrospective, Cooper Union, Oct. 3, 1996_  
  
Good design adds value of some kind, gives meaning, and, not incidentally, can
be sheer pleasure to behold; it respects the viewer’s sensibilities and
rewards the entrepreneur.  
  

_— Design Form and Chaos_

  

Without play, there would be no Picasso. Without play, there is no
experimentation. Experimentation is the quest for answers.  
  

_— Graphic Wit “Paul Rand: The Play Instinct” 1991_

  

Mies van der Rohe once said that being good is more important than being
original. Originality is a product, not an intention.
