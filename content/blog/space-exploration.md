Great piece of engineering! How many years did it take for us to reach here.
But there is one question that everyone is asking. "Is it worth spending so
much on it?" I don't know how much does it cost? Pretty lot. So....should we
stop? Hmmm.  

  

Imgaine yourself, one fine morning you wake up and find yourself in a deserted
island. You look everywhere and you can't find anything that looks like you.
Remember Tom Hanks in Cast Away. Well yup pretty much like it. What would you
do?

  

First you would see if there is any one. Not finding anyone, you would slowly
try to survive in the environment and you may live or die. If you die its the
end. But if you are alive what would you do next? Explore! you would explore
unless you are lazy. And believe me some people are so lazy that they have
lost their human instinct. Now that is the correct word "INSTINCT".

  

After much time, you would also start to wonder about life and question your
existence. When you finally think its time to put yourself on the captains
seat and explore, you would.

  

And there are few who can take these initiatives. So in a bigger picture what
we are doing by spending money in Space Exploration is that we are following
our instinct. We are searching for a reason of our existence and it is very
important for us to do so. For us to know that we are doing something about
it. Though yes, the whole thing might have been started due to the cold war or
the warm war. It makes sense to me to try and explore.

  

Yes, we may be wasting a lot of capital but can we stop ourselves from not
tring to know our origin. Do we still have space in us for these kinds of
questions or have we lost all our enthusiasm in it. I don't want to argue if
it is right or wrong to do so, simply because I can't justify neither.

  

But I can assure you that once you stop searching, you are sure to find
yourself in a BIG deadlock in your life.
