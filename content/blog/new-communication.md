I have got nothing to share, neither anything to tell. I have no thoughts
neither any views. I have no reason neither any goals. Here I am, just giving
my fingers an exercise of a day. Fingers moving up and down, eyes following
the moving cursor in my laptop and brain pumping a THINK tank. Lets blog, I
say to myself.  
  
Haven't been writing anything. Not cause I am busy or that I have no time. I
simple have nothing to blog.  
  
With the SOCIAL MEDIA hype and all people going nuts. I am just lost. People
these days want to say a lot in just few words.... I guess we call it
[tweeting](http://www.twitter.com). The words are getting shorter and the
feelings are getting lost... That is what I feel most of the time but may be
its a changing world. A new world, where communication is something entirely
different.  
  
This made be remember one term its called "NewSpeak", a term used by[ George
Orwell in his book 1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell). If you
have read the book or know about it. What this New Speak, is something similar
to the New Changing ways of communication. Its language where the words have
been deleted and emotion has been ripped away from the words so that when
people communicate they are exactly telling each other what they want to.
Though the main aim of "NewSpeak " was discouraging
[INDIVIDUALISM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism). I don't know how
far this new communication of ours are going forward. I can only think.  
  
May be I am wrong in this but its my thoughts. A changing ways of
communication.
