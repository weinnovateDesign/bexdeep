Inception of the Idea Ok. So here are the two different levels of monitoring
that can be done on social media. 1\. Social Media Space Basically finding out
leads and their influence in the social media. Their social media profiles and
much more detail. 2\. Social Media Channels Measuring the health of the social
media channels and their influence in the space. Basically, monitoring the
performance of the channels and handling down the optimization techniques. The
last one that is present in both is the profile influence analysis. bexdeep
