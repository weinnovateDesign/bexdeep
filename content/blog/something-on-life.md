look at it. As I was playing with MSpaint, I made it just for fun. Then,
somebody comes and tells me, wow, is it an abstract art. I go "Mmmmmm, I
donno."  

  

But he doesnot stop there, he pulls down the chair and sits and stares at it.
I think you have portrayed a life. And I go LIFE!. How can it be life. Then he
goes away leaving me confused. Then I stay confused and totally flattered in a
way. "LIFE" I am thinking. But how?

  

Then I draw the same in paper and try figuring it out. Life Huh. So I toss the
paper, and see if I can see it. Nop not from this angle and I go and see from
other angle. No no. I think I am getting something wrong. For about 15 minutes
I stare at it like a zombie. Inside me there is this voice shouting "LIFE". If
I can just see it. But no. I get frustated. I try coloring it and making it
look as stupid and as abstract but I have no success. I go as far as I can. I
burn it. I tear it. I flip it. I take it near to the mirror. It try to look at
it from different perspective. I try to create a mathematical equation for it
but still no Life. Dammn. I must be a fool. How can he see it but not me.

  

After much frusted hours I look back at it and see its no longer what I made
it before. It is no longer so simple. Now it has become more complex and
absurd and totally stupid. I give it one more glance. Then I realize
something. I smile to myself. I tear the paper off and walk out of the room. I
am satisfied, I think to myself. Now I see the Life. Can you?
