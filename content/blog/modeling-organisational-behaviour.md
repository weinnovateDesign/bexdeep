How often have you been able to predict your friend's behaviour. Hmm. Many
times, isn't it? That is because, you have been spending years and years of
time with your friend, so you know how your friend is going to react to a
situation, unless the situation is something that is very very new. But, there
are certain situations when, you get amazed by your friends behaviour and say
"Ohh, I didn't know you thought that way?"  

  

So, again, is it possible to predict the behaviour of Organisation. Very
roughly, yes. This is what a social scientist try exploring and it requires a
very high analytical observation. Also, you need to analyse the historical
data for better understanding of the organisation. The possibility of
predicting an organisation and an individual is somehow different.

Organisation is a group of people connected with certain norms and values. The
existence of the organisation is important for the sake of its goal and
philosophy. Organisation put its goal in first priority, that is for what it
exist. Therefore, many often we hear of sacrifices in a group for the sake of
existence of the group. That might sound odd but it is the core fundamentals
of being in a group. It is the in born social structure that cannot be broken.

  

So, with these basic understanding of how a group works and proceeds with its
goal, is important to be analysed. There will be lots of data and historical
events that is of significance to understanding the nature of the
organisation.

  

With careful analysis and better approximation, I feel it is possible to
predict the act of an organisation. Some of the field that could benefit from
it is:

  

  

1\. Modeling the [Consumer ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer)of Market

2\. Modeling the pack of certain [Animal
Species](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species)  

3\. Modeling the behaviour of
[Criminals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminals)

4\. Modeling the behaviour of band of gangs, may be a [Terrorist
Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_group) and so on.

  

In this way, it is a field which can be of tremendous helpful in understanding
the organisation and learn the ways to optimise it.
