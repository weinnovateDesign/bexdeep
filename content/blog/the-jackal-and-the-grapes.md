Its a moral story and like all the moral stories, it takes a life time for
people to understand what it means. Here is one story about a jackal and the
grapes, that I remembered. I had heard it when I was a child. I started
pondering upon it again, and did a little thinking and thought experiment into
it. Here is how it went:  

  

Old one : Jackal is trying to eat the grapes from a tree but he can't reach
the branches so he tells his friends (hiding his disappointment), " You know,
I could have reached there, but the grapes are really sour. "

  

But its not only one situation, I have found a new one:

  

New one: Jackal is trying to eat the grapes from a tree, he jumps for hours
and finally reaches the branch and eats the grapes. But the grapes turns out
to be sour. So he tells his friend (hiding his disappointment), "Oh my god,
its the sweetest grapes I have ever tasted. Yummy .. "

  

Well what do you make out of these stories? I will end with this last one,
chose your favorite:)

  

Last one: Jackal is trying to eat the grapes from a tree, he jumps for hours
and finally reaches the branch and eats the grapes. But the grapes turns out
to be sour. So he tells his friend, " What the hell!! Whats this? its too sour
man. Let go try another tree."

  

There you go.
