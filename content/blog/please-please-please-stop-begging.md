Now and then I come across some of the proposals written for the sake of
development. Asking help and for financial support. Then I find the most
cliches sentence :

  

"[Nepal ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal)is one of the poorest country in
the world"

  

SO PROUD TO BE POOR!

  

I am sick and tried of reading pages and pages of justification on how poor
Nepal is or we are. So helpless and so bound by the situation, we seek HELP.

  

Let me tell you a real life situation:

  

As a child, I have seen beggars begging in the street of [New
Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Road_of_Kathmandu). Then I use to
think, that these beggars will certainly not beg forever. I thought they might
some day come out of it when they have enough savings. But I still see the
same beggars today, in the same street begging. What a sad story?

  

Why? And only WHY? Haven't they have had enough of money to be not begging.
Then I might be criticized that, "Hey, Deep... They are begging they don't get
enough so they have to beg again. They don't have saving ACCOUNT. Deep be
realistic."

  

EXACTLY. That is my point. Begging doesn't make you rich. It makes you lazy
and dependable. A parasite. A social parasite. If you need development, you
need to WORK not BEG.

STOP spreading you hands for money. WORK, if you can.
