Yes, all the things that you can do in the online social network. How
interesting and imaginative!  

  

But, do you think all the classical social theories apply to the [online
community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_community). I mean does the
human behaviour change in the Virtual World or is it the same any way? There
are chances that the Virtual Worlds may see a human behaviour that is not seen
in the real world. That might be strange. I mean, how can it vary. But the
chances are that they will. This can be due to the new possibilities and the
moral issues that bind us in the online network.

  

The geographical barriers are breaking and a new kind of community is taking
shape in the clouds and in the electrical database.

  

I have only one question. Is this the
[MATRIX](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/)? Do you think that someday, we
will be so into the virtual worlds that we will forget that the real world
exists and that we may need some kind of saviour to make ourselves conscious
of it. Think about it.
