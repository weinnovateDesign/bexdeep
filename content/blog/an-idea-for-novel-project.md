This idea originated long time back while i was visiting a temple with my
mother. Since then the idea has stuck wih me and i have been thinling about it
lately. This time i think i know how it can be executed. Its a novel writing
project which will require extensive resear ch in nepali mythology and
history. I will have to include someone in the team to start a project of this
scale and this will be more than a year project. Will have read lots of
stories and books to understand the culture and spend time with it. Its no
going to be so easy but we can sufely start on it. This will be side project
of mi e wuich i will have to complete.
