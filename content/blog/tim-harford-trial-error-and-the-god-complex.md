I really don't have anything to write this time. Though I have many thoughts
winding up in my head. But then, after a very long time I stumbled upon a good
video in TED. This is regarding the complex system and solving the real
problems through trial and error.  
  
Though I could not help noticing Tim Harford, calling Hans Rosling the Mick
Jagger of TED. By the way, Tim's book Undercover Economists is a great read
for any one.  
  
Bottom Line : "Its very difficult to make GOOD mistakes."
