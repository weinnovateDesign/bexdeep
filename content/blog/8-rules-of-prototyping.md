As an engineer or a project leader, it is of utmost importance to get your
product ready for the market. And all this starts with an idea of the product
itself. Today, the information is so omnipresent that it is easier to get lost
into the jungle of products and forget the essence of engineering, which is
prototyping.  
  
There are many people around us who can build things and do unimaginable
things, but there are very few who can make it to the market and succeed. In
my years of experience and engineering studies, I have noticed that
engineering is all about following the discipline of innovation and being
serious about the overall picture of the innovation. Hence comes the
importance of prototyping, cause, itâ€™s the initial step which gives you the
clear idea on how your product is going to look like and function.  
  
Prototyping gives you a vivid idea about the essence of the product and lets
you make further decision. Early today, I received a mail from NI
instrumentation on their regular newsletter and the topic was 8 rules of
prototyping, as I read through the paragraphs I found the article very
relevant and thought of adding my own views on it. Below are the eight points
noted by NI, but I am going to add my own understanding of the scenario and
make a clean breast of it.
