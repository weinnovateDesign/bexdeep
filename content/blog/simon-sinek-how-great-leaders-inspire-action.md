This must be one of the most powerful and yet simple presentation on success
and failure. Simon Sinek simply puts the basic facts of life with
corroborative examples and case studies.  
  
The main idea behind the story is that we have three layers of communicating
our ideas to people : Why, How and What. If you move from Why to What, you are
most likely to succeed but if you move vice-versa, its the opposite.
