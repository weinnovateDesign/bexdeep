This is a very interesting talk on how the vessel or the medium is the key of
how the emotion takes its shape. David Byrne goes on to compare different
music style and their venue and how they fit perfectly to each other.  
  
At the end, I could not help remembering  Marshall McLuhan's statement "[The
Medium is the Message](http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/mcluhan.html)."
