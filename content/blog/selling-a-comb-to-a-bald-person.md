Here my friend, Ashay, put it very truly to me that the marketer's most
challenge is to sell a comb to a bald. First, I am not trying to justify
anything here. But I just couldn't help thinking how on earth am I going to
sell a comb to a bald. How? Just how? I kept pondering upon it till late
night. I actually had very few options with me, the first was obviously to use
Google and Find? :)  

  

But, I didn't do that. Some how I was still in confusion. Then just before
going to sleep, I had an discussion with my other friend, on types of
marketing on issues related to [customer
centric](http://goodexperience.com/2004/10/introducing-the-customercentri.php)
marketing. Hmm. Then some how it hit me. I went back to basic on my own
philosophy, sell things that is needed. So here is a small anecdote I prepared
:

  

Sale Person : Hello sir. How are you? Do you have a time, plzzz?

  

Bald Person : (Almost confused and in social causality) OK OK what is it? I
don't have time.

  

Sale Person : Here sir, do you want to by a comb?

  

Bald Person : Can't you see I am bald? Don't mock me. (angrily)

  

(Obviously, sales person must have observed it, but here we have an
intelligent one. )

  

Sale Person : Sir, you are the one who need it more then anyone.  

  

Bald Person : (Confused and Humiliated) What nonsense?  

  

Sale Person : Well, sir we have a special package just for people like
you.With this comb you get a wig free. On top of that you have a color choice.
:)

Hmm. What was it? Hope not a bad joke in an early morning. Well, my point was,
it was no point arguing with the bald on proving him that he needed comb,
unless, he is dumb. Now, I am still thinking and I find that may be this is
not only the way, there are more that this. I am starting to believe that may
be, just may be, what you need to do is first decide whether you really want
to sell or not? If yes, then the ideas will just come to you. Hope so.

  

So, giving him an alternative might sound good. Just a thought. What would you
do?
