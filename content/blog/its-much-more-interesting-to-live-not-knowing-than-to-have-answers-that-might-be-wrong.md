Every now and then, I give myself a time to re-explore myself just to make
sure that I am doing the right thing for myself. And in this exploration, I
come across interesting characters and lifes that either inspires me or lets
me understand myself more clearly. Usually there always has been this time
period of 6 months for my self exploration. Yes, exactly 6 months of setting
urself free from rules and restarting your journey.  
  
I met Richard Feynman after I completed by A level, though I was being
introduced to him during my physic class by my physic teacher. I had exactly 6
months to explore him in/out. I picked up his famous book : "Surely you must
be joking, Mr Richard Feynman.", the rest is history. Every now and then, I
try my best to introduce to others, but I leave the rest to them. And today, I
am trying again to re-introduce him through these wonderful videos.
