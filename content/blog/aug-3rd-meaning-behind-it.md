screen-shots of my diary on August 3rd  
I live a philosophical life with full concentration on wholeness rather than a
single celled ideology. So I have come to see that August 3rd is more
important to me than my birthday, cause this is the day when I actually
started my journey into the wilderness with full consiousness.  
  
It was on August 3 that I started my newly owned life in Bangalore.
Remembering my uncertainty at that time, the only thing I was sure about was
finding myself. I think I have in many ways found myself in last 3 years.
There is this wonderful saying - "You change because you have not found
yourself yet". So I am still changing and the process of perfecting continues.  
  
It also happens that unknowingly, I tend to take into new journey every
August. May be its because of its position in the yearly calender. But beside
me, I know that there are hundred of Nepalese students who embark on their
educational journey to America, UK and other areas on this very month. Which
says more about the auspiciousness of the month. And I think many people out
there will agree that there is certain mystery around August month.  
  
But not all my journey on August have turned out better. I have had bitter
experiences on some August where disappointment have lead me to take different
path. But different path is always there for a good. So I am eagerly waiting
for the new revelation which should happen this year.  
  
But I am already optimistic about this year, as my this August have started
with a wonderful delight. With new journey and risk, there is always new
people to meet and create new relationships. I must say, this August has
surprised me :) and I am looking forward to it. This means that I have already
taken one risk, now there is the second one that I need to take.  
  
For last 3 years, entrepreneurship has taught me lot and continues to do so,
never stopping. And I always feel, its the start and not the end, and many
things happen in between.  
  
One more interesting fact about August, which I found and was delighted by it
:
