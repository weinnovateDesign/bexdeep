I am a great fan of Japanese Animator[ Hayao
Miyazaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki), who has great
sensibility in story telling. Some of his greatest works include : Spirited
Away, Castle in the Sky and Porco Rosso. The other Japanese Animator who is
also known as the God of Manga is [Osamu
Tezuka.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka) His work includes the
famous Animation ASTRO BOY.  
  
One of the traits of these animators are not their animation skills, which
off-course is to par with excellence, but their honestly in story telling. Now
animation is a pretty time consuming process that requires a lot of planning
and creativity than any other story telling process.  
  
Though modern animation means more of 3D models and realistic visual graphics,
2D animation can also be as much interesting as any other realistic 3D
animations. Below are some of the weirdest animations to illustrate the
variety in 2D animation and detailing which can be achieved in story telling
process.  
  

Below is the animation from Osamu Tezuka, you can clearly see the detail of
the animation and the visual effect. Now lets see some of the weirdest of all.
You can find tons in Youtube. :)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
This animation cannot really be told as 3D or 2D, the whole style has been
merged to give completely new experience.  
  
  
  
This is a weird example of story telling, but yet it seems subtle in its
detail.  
  
  
  
  
  
This animation just shows the level of detail simple sketches can have and its
tremendous impact on viewers.  
  
  
  
Now obviously, this doesn't mean 3D are not expressive enough. Below are some
of the weird and witty animations.
