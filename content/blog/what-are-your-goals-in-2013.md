Its almost an end of January 2013, and I feel like I need to re look at my
goals for the year. On my [last year's
post](http://www.bexdeep.com/2011/01/rejoicing-new-year-2011.html) I had
mentioned that new year is always important because it gives people a reason
to look back and make new plans. Further, its also the only occasion where
millions of people decide to make a change within themselves. It gives hope
and new energy to start fresh. Hope in all its form is the last and the best
medicine for many problems.  
  
I personally feel that 2013 is going to be a critical one and an important
one. Its the year when all the dots are going to align themselves. And I can
for real, check if last few years of my life made any sense. And check if all
the dots indeed do connect.  
  
And for all, I hope to write more. Among many pending projects writing more is
in one of the top priority and I should be pursuing it more. Besides this,
there are few interesting things on the pipeline which is exciting. They
should be pouring down in my blog soon..
