Few days back I had posted a three series long video with a title "Everything
is a Remix". The focus of these idea is that nothing is original and
everything is a mass-up of previous works. Though this thought might be
frustrating for some of the artists who believes in pure originality, but it
is true in many extent that originality doesn't exist.  
  
Ideas are always shared and borrowed. What matters most is the attitude with
which an artist take upon others work. There are many who simple copy
blatantly.  With the same reasoning and principal, there is another bloggers
who have stumbled upon an interesting result of his own works.
