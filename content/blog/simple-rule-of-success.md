Simple Rule of Success. Passion. I won't argue and I won't justify. Its there
for everyone to understand.

You read hundreds of books, watch thousands of movies and read millions of
blog, but the fact is not going to change.  
  
There was one old Archie's comic strip which I remember reading. When Archie
asks Dilton, "How to pass an exam?" Dilton replies, "Just Study." And I think
that was well put.  
  
But people are lazy by nature and are always looking for hacks in their lives
and many people are ok with living their life that way.  
  
But if you are truly looking for success coming from within and unpretentious,
then its passion. Look every genuine winners around and you will find that
they had something unique to offer with their passion to gain in real terms
and not in terms of hacks.
