So here is the idea which I have been pondering among, " how to build a
sustainable community?" An important question, I suppose for all the
developing and under developing nations. But this is a question not only among
the nation builders but also among brands. Today, brands are competing head on
to build a community around its services and products. So what is the right
way?

  

I suppose there are different methods to it. For example, lets take an
analogy:

  

Lets say, I build a house, equip it with furniture and all the necessary
resources like food and energy. Then I invite people to come to the house and
stay over. I think it will be wrong to assume that the people will finally
evolve into a community because this is not how a community is built. This
particular format is more like a Reality TV show format, and we all know that
this format is not designed to be sustainable but to collapse with time.
Because in Reality TV show format, rather than building a community, it
disintegrates into one single member - who will be the winner.

  

Community is mostly build out of necessity. It starts with few people, there
is a reason and context behind their meet, then they communicate, collaborate
and create. As a result, they build their surrounding to suit their needs and
hence we have a community. This community is more sustainable.

  

So what is my point? My point is that instead of investing in infrastructure
and resources, the first thing that any community or nation builders must
invest is on PEOPLE. Cause investing in people will empower people who will
then there by communicate, collaborate and create.

  

Its like game of life. Currently, there are millions of small communities
competing to exist and sustain the changes. Few will raise and fall, few will
remain unheard but some will leave a legacy. Community doesn't have to die,
but they surely change with time.
