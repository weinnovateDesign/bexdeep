So finally, the revolution begins with the advent of new year 2009. Hear about
InRev from its CEO, [Bhupendra
Khanal](http://www.blogger.com/profile/11979831334460992121) ,

starts-now.html).

  

What is InRev?

  

InRev is a new way of looking at the infomation available in the web or out of
web. It promises to bring the necessary information to the public at the top
level, rather than confuse the user with complicated lists of variables. How?
Well, you all have to be patience for that.

  

InRev plans to use multiple-technology, be it software or hardware, to solve
the real world problem and bring them to the public.

  

Team in InRev have come a long way to bringing this company to life, and is
now finally on its way to becoming public. It feels great to see how it has
come up so far, with so many ups and downs.  

  

The team in InRev is bonded with the passion to bring new insight into the
business world and that is what it survives to do.

  

Cheers to the team of InRev and hope the new year will bring new face to the
world. I am glad to be the part of the team.
