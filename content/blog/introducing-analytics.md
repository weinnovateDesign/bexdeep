Let us jump right into the graph. What do you make out of it?

  

The graph has been taken by using the
[google.com/trends](http://www.google.com/trends).

  

lets see.

Four different words has been compared with each other on the bases of how
many times they were searched in the google.

  

Does these words(sony, hp, apple, dell) mean anything to you? Well its obvious
that these are related with the four different big brand names. Well then,
what can you infer from the graph? Straight away, you can say that the word
sony has been searched more often then the the others, showing its relative
popularity among the people. But watch out the result is related only to the
United Kingdom region. May be in other region, its different.

  

But is that it? Is that the only thing we can infer from the graph. Well lets
think over it. Can't it have any relation to the share market values? Does the
two different types of trends have some relationships with each other. Is it
possible to infer the trend in share values by looking at the trend in its
popularity in google?

  

Well, may be yes. May be it is possible to do so. Or may be and just may be
its even possible to predict the future values too.

  

Analytics is just the field that is trying to deals with these unquestionable
questions.

  

Look, Observe, Transpose and Deduce. But the steps are not so simple as it
looks. There are many different and complex mathematical theories that can
play into the process of deduction. Hence it turns out that Analytics is just
the other field on its way to becoming engineered.

  

Well next time, I will try to explore just what complexity may rise during the
process of analysis. It a pure science of deduction. But when you get it just
right then its what [Sherlock
Holmes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes) would say, "Elementary ,
my dear Watson, elementary."
