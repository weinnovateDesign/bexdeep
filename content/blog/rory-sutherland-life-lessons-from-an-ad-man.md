This is a very interesting talk from Rory Sutherland on the element of
perceived value and the real value.  
Though the talk could raise lot of issues about the moral values in the realm
of advertisement and the emerging world of media and user-generated content,
its at the same time interesting to see how we can solve our problems through
lateral thinking.
