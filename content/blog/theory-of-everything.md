Being from the scientific background, things like this really brings a sense
of wonder. The whole purpose of life unsettles itself and gives you a kick on
your back. I have loved mathematics and physics since the time I remember
pursing science. This is not only a remarkable theory, of which I still
haven't grasped much but the things he says at the end is really touching and
emotional.

  

"I got my PhD and looked at my options. I love differential geometry, general
relativity, and particle physics. But the only options available then for a
postdoc in those combined areas were in string theory, and I thought string
theory was overly speculative. There are many really impressive aspects of
strings — anomaly cancelation in particular — but there are other things that
just seem wild and physically unsubstantiated. I had gotten lucky by investing
my graduate stipend in a little company many thought was going out of business
(AAPL), so I decided to go to Maui, learn to windsurf, and work on physics on
my own."

through the whole of theory, it will take lot time to understand but here is a
link which you can follow to understand and if u do let me know ;).
