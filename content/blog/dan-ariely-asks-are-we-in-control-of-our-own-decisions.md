Decision making is a fundamental action that we are involved in our day to day
life. Every time we make decision, we have this feeling that we are making a
right one. We look into the pros and cons of the situation and try to
understand the effect of our decision. But we tend to forget that when we make
decision we have cognitive limitations similar to physical limitation.  
  
This video below is a very good presentation by Dan Ariely on how we are
affected by the choices and how that influences our decision. It is a
wonderful presentation.
