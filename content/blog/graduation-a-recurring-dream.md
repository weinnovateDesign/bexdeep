I didn’t go to my graduation - I couldn’t make it. There was no cap swinging
or photo taking celebration with certificates and friends. Like many other
moments of life, it simply skipped without a knock on the door or any hello
and goodbyes.  
  
May be thats why, even after so many years I still dream of graduating. Its
one of those recurring dreams where you are still at your final year of
college. The dream typically starts with the confusion of not knowing the
exact date of your examination and you are frantically calling you friends to
confirm the date.  
  
I always find myself in my old room, surrounded by notes and books. Nervous
and Confused. Within the dream, sometime I keep questioning “Am I back in
home? How and Why?” Then as the time passes by in the dream, the day of
examination comes closer and things gets hazy. I try calling friends, no one
is there receiving my calls.  
  
There are multiple routes in the dream. In one, I make to the examination hall
and end up realising I studied the wrong subject and stare blank at the
question paper - knowing that I am not going to pass this exam. The other one
is more confusing, I end up reaching college after the exam is over and seeing
all my friends discussing the question paper. Both way, the result is always
the same - I am not graduating.  
  
This tense feeling and realisation of being left out, goes beyond explanation.
But some how, every time my conscious self fights back to bring me back to the
reality. And when I finally realise that its a dream, I am sucked out of it.  
  
I end up waking up in shock and look around to see if its real. And I try to
ensure to my self - have I already graduated?
