This time around,  
Sun peeked from the west.  
To check how,  
Moon was doing on its own.  
  
Alone among the stars,  
with dark patches around the eyes,  
Moon was beaming through the cosmos,  
casting shadows in the dark.  
  
With no voices around,  
and clamour of the day,  
Moon stood there listening,  
to the silence of the night.
