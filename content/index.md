# bexdeep's blog posts

I started blogging in 2008. I shared my naive thoughts on design, technology and society online.

I made a commentary on online trends and unabashedly criticised them.

But since 2015/16, I stopped regularly writing. I was busy. But I was also tired and didn't see any purpose of my writings. They started to sound ramblings and incoherent.

I continued to write in professional manner and something on private notes.

This site is an archive of those writings stored here for my personal reference.
