# bexdeep's blog posts

I started blogging in 2008. I shared my naive thoughts on design, technology, arts and culture.

But since 2015/16, I stopped publishing blog posts. I was busy. But, I was also tired and didn't see any purpose in my writings. They started to sound random ramblings and incoherent.

I continued to write in professional manner and in private.

This site is an archive of those writings for my personal reference.
