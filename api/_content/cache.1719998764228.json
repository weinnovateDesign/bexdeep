A\ncommunity is a combination of people with variety of skills and interest,\nwhich can be channelized for betterment of the society. Any rejection of such\nhuman resource could result into migration. Then comes the efficient economy\nof the society and how they can be managed without much lose.

The traditional printed comics contains the\nregular flow of the screen-shots of the story. But once I had seen a video on\nTED where the comic creator was talking about the concept of spatial in comics\nand how the internet could revolutionize the comic. I think it will take time\nfor such concept to be widely accepted. As I was going throughnbsp;\nhttp://scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/index.html, it occurred to me that the\nslide presentation can be used to create a pseudo space where the story can be\npresented. It will depend upon the the use of arrow keys like Up, Down, Front\nand Back. But lets see how it goes. The idea is to control the space of the\nstory through the arrow keys. When you press Front, the space will move front\nand when you click Back, the space will move back. Lets see how it will go.\nbexdeep https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-4387828399064703641\n2010-12-30T00:26:00.001-08:00 2010-12-30T00:26:32.578-08:00 Two levels of\nsocial monitoring Inception of the Idea Ok.

Their\nsocial media profiles and much more detail. 2. Social Media Channels\nMeasuring the health of the social media channels and their influence in the\nspace.

Yes indeed. If you look into the how social media\nmarketing is done than you will find out that every industry and business has\nsame tool and same opportunity. But due to the difference in how consumers\ninteract with the business, the nature of strategies differs in social media.\nFor example, interacting with people in Indonesia could completely differ from\nthat in India. So it boils down to the trend in what affects consumers in\nlarge extent. So comes the theory of Psychology. If you can understand the\npsychology of consumer than you can surely interact with people in social\nmedia and gain their attention. As a result, its very imminent that people who\nhave cracked this secret in social media are doing great things. Therefore, my\nstatement that Social Media is Psychology makes a lot more sense. bexdeep\nhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794 noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-225346282737123260\n2011-01-19T19:20:00.001-08:00 2011-01-19T19:21:24.076-08:00 Consumer Economy\nFree Information has given opportunity for consumers to be producers and give\nrise to different kind of economy.

I call it quot;The Fabric of\nEconomyquot;. Its a basic concept that every human being should have equal\neconomic opportunity in their life. Hence anyone that tries to distort the\nfabric of economy should be penalized. At the core of economy is the\nquot;informationquot;. The free availability of information ensures stability\nin the economy, as far as I am concern. But there are ways in which\ninformation matters. Each kind of their information has their own priority and\neffect on the global economy. What is more important is the stability of the\neconomy and opportunity rather than arguing the openness of the information.\nbexdeep https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-9062474247128492938\n2011-01-18T04:57:00.001-08:00 2011-01-18T05:07:07.071-08:00 Comic Style\nPresentation with Space Conscious There are lots of technique in which comics\nare being produced and made. The traditional printed comics contains the\nregular flow of the screen-shots of the story. But once I had seen a video on\nTED where the comic creator was talking about the concept of spatial in comics\nand how the internet could revolutionize the comic. I think it will take time\nfor such concept to be widely accepted. As I was going throughnbsp;\nhttp://scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/index.html, it occurred to me that the\nslide presentation can be used to create a pseudo space where the story can be\npresented. It will depend upon the the use of arrow keys like Up, Down, Front\nand Back. But lets see how it goes. The idea is to control the space of the\nstory through the arrow keys. When you press Front, the space will move front\nand when you click Back, the space will move back. Lets see how it will go.\nbexdeep https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-4387828399064703641\n2010-12-30T00:26:00.001-08:00 2010-12-30T00:26:32.578-08:00 Two levels of\nsocial monitoring Inception of the Idea Ok.

Yes indeed. If you look into the how social media\nmarketing is done than you will find out that every industry and business has\nsame tool and same opportunity. But due to the difference in how consumers\ninteract with the business, the nature of strategies differs in social media.\nFor example, interacting with people in Indonesia could completely differ from\nthat in India. So it boils down to the trend in what affects consumers in\nlarge extent. So comes the theory of Psychology. If you can understand the\npsychology of consumer than you can surely interact with people in social\nmedia and gain their attention. As a result, its very imminent that people who\nhave cracked this secret in social media are doing great things. Therefore, my\nstatement that Social Media is Psychology makes a lot more sense. bexdeep\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794"}]},{"type":"text","value":" "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"mailto:noreply@blogger.com"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"noreply@blogger.com"}]},{"type":"text","value":" 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-225346282737123260\n2011-01-19T19:20:00.001-08:00 2011-01-19T19:21:24.076-08:00 Consumer Economy\nFree Information has given opportunity for consumers to be producers and give\nrise to different kind of economy.

I call it quot;The Fabric of\nEconomyquot;. Its a basic concept that every human being should have equal\neconomic opportunity in their life. Hence anyone that tries to distort the\nfabric of economy should be penalized. At the core of economy is the\nquot;informationquot;. The free availability of information ensures stability\nin the economy, as far as I am concern. But there are ways in which\ninformation matters. Each kind of their information has their own priority and\neffect on the global economy. What is more important is the stability of the\neconomy and opportunity rather than arguing the openness of the information.\nbexdeep "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"mailto:noreply@blogger.com"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"noreply@blogger.com"}]},{"type":"text","value":" 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-9062474247128492938\n2011-01-18T04:57:00.001-08:00 2011-01-18T05:07:07.071-08:00 Comic Style\nPresentation with Space Conscious There are lots of technique in which comics\nare being produced and made.

Yes indeed. If you look into the how social media\nmarketing is done than you will find out that every industry and business has\nsame tool and same opportunity. But due to the difference in how consumers\ninteract with the business, the nature of strategies differs in social media.\nFor example, interacting with people in Indonesia could completely differ from\nthat in India. So it boils down to the trend in what affects consumers in\nlarge extent. So comes the theory of Psychology. If you can understand the\npsychology of consumer than you can surely interact with people in social\nmedia and gain their attention. As a result, its very imminent that people who\nhave cracked this secret in social media are doing great things.

I call it quot;The Fabric of\nEconomyquot;. Its a basic concept that every human being should have equal\neconomic opportunity in their life. Hence anyone that tries to distort the\nfabric of economy should be penalized. At the core of economy is the\nquot;informationquot;. The free availability of information ensures stability\nin the economy, as far as I am concern. But there are ways in which\ninformation matters.
