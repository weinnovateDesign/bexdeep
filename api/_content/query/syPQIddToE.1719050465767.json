His name is Hayao Miyazaki, a Japanese animator who have\nproduced one of the most fascinating series of animations, but more properly I\nwould tell he is one of the best story teller that I was seen."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"His animations are not just figures and shapes moving but a manifestation of a\nstory which is larger than life. The first movie that I saw of his was \"The\nSpirited Away\". Before this I had watched other Japanese animations but they\nwere more into actions and adventures. But this was completely different, I\nthink I was lucky to have watched it."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The story line of \"The Spirited Away\" was magnificent and out of the box. The\nexperience it set was unquestionable. There was nothing in the movie which\nsounded cheap or pretentious. You could easily notice the thoughtfulness and\nthe passion gone into making the movie. After that I started watching his more\nmovies. Till date, I found that he has made nine movies and after having\nwatched all of that, it got me into thinking that there is a place for soulful\nmovies and stories and not all the world is full of crap :)). Yupe you can\nfind lots of movie making business out of selling their soul in the movie for\nthe sake of viewers. But once in  a while, a good movie, a good story, a good\nbook fills you heart with love for the life like nothing else."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"[![]("},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"http://www.miyazaki-film.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/merveilleux-","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"http://www.miyazaki-film.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/merveilleux-"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\nhayao-miyazaki1.jpg)]("},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"http://www.miyazaki-film.com/wp-","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"http://www.miyazaki-film.com/wp-"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\ncontent/uploads/2009/05/merveilleux-hayao-miyazaki1.jpg)"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"So what is so important about the story telling which is unique? I think its\nthe love for life, if you see all the movies of Miyazaki, you won't fail to\nnotice the passion to life, he brings to his stories. From a humble Kiki's\nDelivery service where a simple girl is just trying to run her small delivery\nservice to a complex world of ghosts and demons in The Spirited Away where a\ngirl fights her way."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I could not help to notice that all the leading characters are female full of\ncourage and passion. I think that means a lot to him. But I found that most of\nthe Japanese Animations have similar strong story telling in their movies. The\nother one movie which I found strange and strong story was \"Grave of the\nFireflies\""}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"These strong movies have also made me think that lot of stories and movies\nbeing made in leading movie studios don't share similar passion for the art of\nstory telling and they are very rare. May be its not the choice of the mass,\nbut anyone who watches movies for passion rather than entertainment would\nunderstand the point that I am making."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Well, I really don't have any ending to this post rather than encouraging you\nall to watch it :) And do comment below if you have found similar passion of\nthe art of story telling. So this is what I think Life is about : _Discovering\nbeautiful and interesting things and sharing with the world for good.  _"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:blog:the-art-of-story-telling.md","_source":"content","_file":"blog/the-art-of-story-telling.md","_stem":"blog/the-art-of-story-telling","_extension":"md"}
