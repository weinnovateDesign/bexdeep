Space\nChannel was just installed in our house and I would spend time watching\ncartoons and other science programs. That was when I noticed gliders and\nparachutes. The shear simplicity of the design took me by surprise. Just to be\nsatisfied, I would take a small stone, tie it around a hanky and throw up in\nthe air. Then I would watch it fall slowly and in a balanced manner. It was\nonly after years, I finally understood that it was a phenomenon called\nTerminal Velocity."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"But throwing plastics around was not much fun. So I would take umbrellas of\ndifferent sizes and jump from certain heights. :) It was very discouraging.\nEither Umbrellas would flip upside down too fast or nothing would  happen. I\nsurely needed to try more than just jumping. This is when I decided that I had\nto make my own glider. So I waited for TV to show gliders. I wish information\nwas much accessible then. Around that time, libraries were not very accessible\nand internet was still much of sci-fi things. But I managed to get enough of\nthe design aspect, though it was some what wrong."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"So one fine Saturday morning, I got up with a shear determination that I was\ngoing to get it done. During those days, Saturday was only the time when you\nhad the whole day for yourselves. School use to run on Sundays and we use to\nhave half-school during Fridays. So on that day, I got up as usual, ate my\nbreakfast, carried my small sketch book and spend some time sketching my\ndesign under the sun. I remember carrying such sketch book till the time I was\nin class 7. After which I some how got lost into mathematics and other heavy\nreading :).

I had my\nown space to play around. I would do all sort of things like I would wander\ncollecting leaves and naming them, sometime I would collect rare stamps. :) It\nwas all fun. But my mummy never let me collect stones, she was very much\nagainst bringing foreign materials inside the house. But whenever I sneaked\nstones in my room, the other day I would find all gone.

Hence making things was\nin my gene I would say. Plus, my uncle was a great craftsman who would make\namazing stuff out of paper and my father himself had often made a cricket bat,\nsnooker sticks :) out of woods and kites to fly around. Mother had hard time\ncalling me for the lunch :). But I would hurriedly go back to my work and\nstart finishing my project. By the evening, everything was ready.
