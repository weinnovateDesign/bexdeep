You have to be willing to take whatever you've done and\nwhoever you were and throw them away. What are we, anyway? Most of what we\nthink we are is just a collection of likes and dislikes, habits, patterns. At\nthe core of what we are is our values, and what decisions and actions we make\nreflect those values. That is why it's hard doing interviews and being\nvisible: As you are growing and changing, the more the outside world tries to\nreinforce an image of you that it thinks you are, the harder it is to continue\nto be an artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to go, \"Bye. I have\nto go. I'm going crazy and I'm getting out of here.\" And they go and hibernate\nsomewhere.

It's a large responsibility to have\nmore than you can spend in your lifetime—and I feel I have to spend it. If you\ndie, you certainly don't want to leave a large amount to your children. It\nwill just ruin their lives. And if you die without kids, it will all go to the\nGovernment. Almost everyone would think that he could invest the money back\ninto humanity in a much more astute way than the Government could. The\nchallenges are to figure out how to live with it and to reinvest it back into\nthe world, which means either giving it away or using it to express your\nconcerns or values."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"JOBS:"}]},{"type":"text","value":" No. There are some simple reasons for that. One is that in order to\nlearn how to do something well, you have to fail sometimes. In order to fail,\nthere has to be a measurement system. And that's the problem with most\nphilanthropy—there's no measurement system. You give somebody some money to do\nsomething and most of the time you can really never measure whether you failed\nor succeeded in your judgment of that person or his ideas or their\nimplementation. So if you can't succeed or fail, it's really hard to get\nbetter. Also, most of the time, the people who come to you with ideas don't\nprovide the best ideas.
