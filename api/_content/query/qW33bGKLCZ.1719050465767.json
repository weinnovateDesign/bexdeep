A lot of times we think \"Why is the television programming so\nbad? Why are television shows so demeaning, so poor?\" The first thought that\noccurs to you is \"Well, there is a conspiracy: the networks are feeding us\nthis slop because its cheap to produce.

And that's far more depressing than a conspiracy.\nConspiracies are much more fun than the truth of the matter, which is that the\nvast majority of the public are pretty mindless most of the time.
