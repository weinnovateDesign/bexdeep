Well, one very important\ndifference between the under developed and the developed country. I came\nacross this difference long time back during my student years, but found it\nvery interesting when it was talked about in one of the debate, in BBC radio.\nThe difference lies in perspective of the science student, in the developing\ncountry and the developed country."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The program in the BBC radio had very interesting point to make. They had two\nteams of science student- one from UK and the other from some Asian country.\nBoth of them were asked why they chose to study science. Remarkably the views\nwere very very different. And off-course it had lot to do with the economic\nconditions of the country."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The students from under developed country told that, they hope to bring the\nchanges in the country, by pursuing science.

They go further into the field rather than their vision. In other\nwords, they get overwhelmed by the depth of knowledge. So knowing becomes more\nimportant than applying the known knowledge. Nothing wrong with going deeper\nwith knowledge, just know when to act when you have it all."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Therefore, its not the field that you choose that is going to help you help\nthe country.

Being practical with your knowledge is what I was trying to tell so\nfar."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"So this difference between the beliefs has really something to tell us about\nthe way we decide what we want to study and why.
