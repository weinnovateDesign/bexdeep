It is not just the matter of a story\nor characters, but the way they decide to introduce them to us. As a director,\nit is their job to make decision on how the story should be narrated to the\naudience. They bring their passion and taste to it, making it a wonderful\nexperience. And more importantly, these directors don't compromise with their\nvision."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Compromising would mean making certain scenes in a way to please the audience\nor the stakeholders.

Product designing\ncomes with a similar process or problem identification, designing solution and\nimplementing them. In this whole process, the project leader makes decision as\nto what to emphasis and what to discard. These choices are going to decide how\nthe product is going to function. After all, product is an emphasis of things.\nProducts are not destined to do everything. They come with their own\nlimitations. It is the matter of the product designer to make sure that the\nchoices based on the priorities of the use cases."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The difficulty in putting emphasis on things are similar for both directors\nand product designers.

The way they decide to tell stories and why they\ndecided to do so. Most of us judge movies based on the story line, plot and\nperformances. These are basic qualities, but there are more to appreciate in\nthe movie than simple story and characters."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This brings me to Editing. A process where things are eliminated and brought\ntogether. A good edited movie is tightly connected and wastes no time of the\naudience.
