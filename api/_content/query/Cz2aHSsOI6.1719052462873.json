Channelizing\nthoughts from a sketch to a first prototype is a reward in itself. Throughout\nmy experience, I have always found that people who have a hobby of doing\npersonal projects have different approach to a problem solving. They seem to\nhave clearer and wider perspective of the problem. They are also more\npractical in their approach and do not hold on to thoughts with a fear of\nfailure. May be its because they have dealt with more failure than anyone in\ntheir lifetime. Overall, they are highly self-motivated and off course they\nare rare."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Self-motivation is the core behind personal projects because you have to deal\nwith no one but yourself in terms of quality and deadlines.

This must be when I was in class 3, where home work\ndiary was still not in the trend so I had to cut white A4 size papers into\nsquare form and tie it down with threads. Soon, I decided to make the form\ncircle and I think I was very much pleased by the eccentricity of the design.\nOffcourse, flaunting it among your friends was more fun. Prior to these, I do\nuse to collect a lot of Super Hero stickers of superman and batman. :)"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nKeeping a \"dictionary\" was much more simple - I just had to get a notebook and\nwrite every new words and their meaning into it."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Beside these, I believe drawing and painting was my key hobby coupled with\nexcessive LEGO structure building, limited by only few hundred pieces. I also\nremember getting a clean notebook and attempting to copy down the whole story\nof \"Goldilocks and 3 bears\". Then making your own \"scrabble\" board was fun\ntoo. I think these attitude made me more self reserved and self satisfied. The\nhabit of getting lost in your own world has remained with me since then."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Its interesting to remember all those school days where I had my school work +\npersonal work. Many friends thought I was too studious spending time studying\nbut people rarely knew I spent time on my own personal work.

So what ever I studied had relevance to my\npersonal work."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"During my school days, I did lot of sketching ideas into paper.
