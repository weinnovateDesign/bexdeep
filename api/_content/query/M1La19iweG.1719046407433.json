The art of analysing goes into not jumping at any conclusion\nwhen you don't have enough data. Its good to assume but not be guaranteed\nabout it. So what do you do?

With different search words we will have different results. So\nlets not go random but systematic in it. Example, 'apple' is not the correct\nsearch word to compare two companies cause apple is a general word with many\nmeanings, so this result of apple doesn't mean that it is the apple company.\nIn engineering term, it means correct your source of information and use a\nvery good filtering mechanism to insure that you are getting particularly what\nyou are searching for. This is not an easy task, remember the source is very\nvery messed up. Thus we have to engineer our way of analysing it. From the\nabove graph we can only assume and also have fun."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The next thing that I wanted to concentrate is the randomness or the noise in\nit. The zigzag of the graph means noise to me cause I don't want it. I want a\nsmooth graph with some logic, not vibrating one unless I am looking at the\noscillating system. In this case, it seems people's interest are oscillating,\nso may be it is an oscillating system.

When every we gave an input to a electronic system, we had a\npeculiarly annoying set of noise. We had less interest in the signal cause\nthat is what we expected but the noise its so unexpected. So we would go head\non with ourselves to eliminate it. But alas, we don't have a practical way of\ndeleting it but only reducing it. The reason is when you are dealing with the\nnoise, you are also dealing with the information. So you have a negative\nfeedback effect."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Surely, these seems less of an business problem than a hardcore engineering\nproblem.
