When you start your company\nfor the first time, you are unaware of the characters and their nature. You\nare unaware of the story and its climax. You are just finding your ways and\nthe only way to figure things out is to make decision and move ahead. You make\nwrong decisions and you sometime get lucky. But that is how you learn. Similar\nto the writing experience, the experience around building a company in a way\nchanges you and your perspective."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When you start with nothing but a passion to do something, you are unaware of\nthe market forces and the eco-system. The eco-system is even not visible to\nyou at the beginning. It unfolds itself slowly and sometime painfully. At\nevery instance, you just need to have faith and that’s all. Even the\ncharacters in the eco-system are undefined. You are always on the dark side\nunable to make quick decision due to the lack of visibility. But as time\npasses by you begin to see the eco-system opening itself to you. This happens\nwhen you have built enough credibility in the market. Now when you begin to\nsee the entire eco-system unfold, there are two things that can happen. Either\nit will be something that you predicted or it will be entirely different. But\nyou can always move on and that’s the whole beauty."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Novel is also similar.

You are always affecting\npeople and their ways of living. To introduce your-self to already existing\nmarket needs much more than just passion. You have to seriously justify your\nexistence and your value to the society. In case of failure to show your\nvalue, you are sure to be lost in the crowd of that 99% failure list. This is\nwhy the failure rate of entrepreneurship is so high.
