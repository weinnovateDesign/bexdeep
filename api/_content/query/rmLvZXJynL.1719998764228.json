But somehow it happened opposite for me. In every stage, as I was\nmoving ahead with my education, I started getting more confused. I had more\nquestions than before. Well it happens all the time and to everyone of us. The\nvision started getting bigger. I started having more subjects as my favourites\nthan before. But normally it doesn't happen this way. Normally we get narrower\nand narrower in our thought. We keeping branching ourselves and finally end up\non the tip of one of the branches. We play a game of choices with ourselves."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The reason, I start writing with a picture is because we first see things and\nthen ask ourselve a quesiton and try to figure out the solution.

Aren't we all\nliving in the same world? May be and also may not be. This is where I am\nstarting to think. The world as seen by a child and a world as seen by an\nadult is completely different. Am I wrong? So.... can a childs vision be of\nany importance to the world, the world which is in itself relative to each one\nof us.

Even then and even now, I am still\nconfused. Cannot clearly see the bigger picture. When will this vision of mine\nwill be clear and focused. But this focus is not like the one found in our\ncamera lenes, cause it can only focus at particular distance. I am talking\nabout the focus which is everywhere and all over. Crystal and Clear.
