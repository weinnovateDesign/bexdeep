WHY? Just why does it have to wind itself. Even nature\nseems helpless to its own structure. Even nature is finding difficulties in\nover-coming itself. But as the scientific reasoning goes, the river will\nultimately take the short-cut and so will the roads. So are we waiting for the\nriver to make the first move?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What if we don't wait and bombard the whole mass of land with bombs and make\nthe way for the river. Isn't that possible? I think it is. But just a second.\nShould we do it? Hmm. Its a same kind of ethical questions that you ask now\nand then again to yourself. So what do we do? Confused. Ya I am full of\nconfusion. So lets ask ourself a new question. Is it necessary to have a road\nthat goes straight through the hills. Well, yes I think. It will make the\njourney fast. But how much capital do you think must be invested to attain\nthis. May be, we can do something better with it then bombarding the place and\nif you are really in hurry, I suggest taking a plane. Well, may be well said."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There is philosophy which says go with the nature and not against it. Because\nif you go against it, you distrub the whole balance of the nature. Imagine in\nthis case, our one stupid step to make a straight road may have impact on the\npeople staying there. Their usual life-style will be distrubed. But I am not\narguing that lets not do it. What I mean is go with the nature and it will\nguide you through. Trying to straighten the river, you may be bending the\nnature. Think about it."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"But everyone has differnt way of thinking.
