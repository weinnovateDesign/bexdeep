Yes indeed. If you look into the how social media\nmarketing is done than you will find out that every industry and business has\nsame tool and same opportunity. But due to the difference in how consumers\ninteract with the business, the nature of strategies differs in social media.\nFor example, interacting with people in Indonesia could completely differ from\nthat in India. So it boils down to the trend in what affects consumers in\nlarge extent. So comes the theory of Psychology. If you can understand the\npsychology of consumer than you can surely interact with people in social\nmedia and gain their attention. As a result, its very imminent that people who\nhave cracked this secret in social media are doing great things. Therefore, my\nstatement that Social Media is Psychology makes a lot more sense. bexdeep\nhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794 noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-225346282737123260\n2011-01-19T19:20:00.001-08:00 2011-01-19T19:21:24.076-08:00 Consumer Economy\nFree Information has given opportunity for consumers to be producers and give\nrise to different kind of economy.

The free availability of information ensures stability\nin the economy, as far as I am concern. But there are ways in which\ninformation matters.
