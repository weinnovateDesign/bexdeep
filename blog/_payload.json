So if you can't succeed or fail, it's really hard to get\nbetter. Also, most of the time, the people who come to you with ideas don't\nprovide the best ideas.

For a long time, I\nhave heard of the importance of scripting in movie industry and importance of\nplanning a project. But what does this plan contain is not being shared by\nanyone. I think it is something that you learn as you move ahead. For more\nthan 2 years in InRev, I have been involved in many projects and have seen\nfirst hand what goes wrong in product development. Its the basic lack of\nvision and planning. No one knows what must be done. So what is scripting.\nWell, I have noticed that even in a simple works like creating an animation or\nmaking an presentation, you need plans. Because a lot of time is spending in\ndoing things, so guideline is very important. Scripting doesn#39;t have to\nfollow any rules or format. I think its a simple presentation of any idea on a\nsimple pieces of paper which you need to sell to others. Ideas sell, isn#39;t\nit. I think script is like a short story which you read and see if you like it\nor not. In that short story you need to capture the essence of project. So I\nam going to try today to do something like that for a small presentation that\nI am planning to make.

Yes indeed. If you look into the how social media\nmarketing is done than you will find out that every industry and business has\nsame tool and same opportunity. But due to the difference in how consumers\ninteract with the business, the nature of strategies differs in social media.\nFor example, interacting with people in Indonesia could completely differ from\nthat in India. So it boils down to the trend in what affects consumers in\nlarge extent. So comes the theory of Psychology. If you can understand the\npsychology of consumer than you can surely interact with people in social\nmedia and gain their attention. As a result, its very imminent that people who\nhave cracked this secret in social media are doing great things. Therefore, my\nstatement that Social Media is Psychology makes a lot more sense. bexdeep\nhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794 noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-225346282737123260\n2011-01-19T19:20:00.001-08:00 2011-01-19T19:21:24.076-08:00 Consumer Economy\nFree Information has given opportunity for consumers to be producers and give\nrise to different kind of economy.

I call it quot;The Fabric of\nEconomyquot;. Its a basic concept that every human being should have equal\neconomic opportunity in their life. Hence anyone that tries to distort the\nfabric of economy should be penalized. At the core of economy is the\nquot;informationquot;. The free availability of information ensures stability\nin the economy, as far as I am concern. But there are ways in which\ninformation matters. Each kind of their information has their own priority and\neffect on the global economy. What is more important is the stability of the\neconomy and opportunity rather than arguing the openness of the information.\nbexdeep https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-9062474247128492938\n2011-01-18T04:57:00.001-08:00 2011-01-18T05:07:07.071-08:00 Comic Style\nPresentation with Space Conscious There are lots of technique in which comics\nare being produced and made. The traditional printed comics contains the\nregular flow of the screen-shots of the story. But once I had seen a video on\nTED where the comic creator was talking about the concept of spatial in comics\nand how the internet could revolutionize the comic. I think it will take time\nfor such concept to be widely accepted. As I was going throughnbsp;\nhttp://scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/index.html, it occurred to me that the\nslide presentation can be used to create a pseudo space where the story can be\npresented. It will depend upon the the use of arrow keys like Up, Down, Front\nand Back. But lets see how it goes. The idea is to control the space of the\nstory through the arrow keys. When you press Front, the space will move front\nand when you click Back, the space will move back.

For a long time, I\nhave heard of the importance of scripting in movie industry and importance of\nplanning a project. But what does this plan contain is not being shared by\nanyone. I think it is something that you learn as you move ahead. For more\nthan 2 years in InRev, I have been involved in many projects and have seen\nfirst hand what goes wrong in product development. Its the basic lack of\nvision and planning. No one knows what must be done. So what is scripting.\nWell, I have noticed that even in a simple works like creating an animation or\nmaking an presentation, you need plans. Because a lot of time is spending in\ndoing things, so guideline is very important. Scripting doesn#39;t have to\nfollow any rules or format. I think its a simple presentation of any idea on a\nsimple pieces of paper which you need to sell to others. Ideas sell, isn#39;t\nit. I think script is like a short story which you read and see if you like it\nor not. In that short story you need to capture the essence of project. So I\nam going to try today to do something like that for a small presentation that\nI am planning to make. Lets see how it goes. bexdeep\n",{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":11977,"children":11979},{"href":5681,"rel":11978},[45],[11980],{"type":24,"value":5681},{"type":24,"value":4242},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":11983,"children":11984},{"href":5687},[11985],{"type":24,"value":5690},{"type":24,"value":11987}," 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-1999520473705109254\n2011-01-28T13:58:00.000-08:00 2011-01-28T13:53:03.050-08:00 Feature discovery\nin product design Many designers believe that usability is a key point in\nproduct design.

The traditional printed comics contains the\nregular flow of the screen-shots of the story. But once I had seen a video on\nTED where the comic creator was talking about the concept of spatial in comics\nand how the internet could revolutionize the comic. I think it will take time\nfor such concept to be widely accepted. As I was going throughnbsp;\nhttp://scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/index.html, it occurred to me that the\nslide presentation can be used to create a pseudo space where the story can be\npresented. It will depend upon the the use of arrow keys like Up, Down, Front\nand Back. But lets see how it goes. The idea is to control the space of the\nstory through the arrow keys. When you press Front, the space will move front\nand when you click Back, the space will move back.

So here are the two different\nlevels of monitoring that can be done on social media. 1. Social Media Space\nBasically finding out leads and their influence in the social media. Their\nsocial media profiles and much more detail. 2. Social Media Channels\nMeasuring the health of the social media channels and their influence in the\nspace. Basically, monitoring the performance of the channels and handling down\nthe optimization techniques. The last one that is present in both is the\nprofile influence analysis. bexdeep\nhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794 noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-5010709563244898751\n2010-12-18T16:19:00.001-08:00 2010-12-18T16:19:44.034-08:00 Intro This blog\nwill be related to all the project ideas and design issues of InRev and other\npersonal project. bexdeep https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794noreply@blogger.com 0","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-1702508697747032111","social-media-is-psychology","2011-01-28T11:50:00.001-08:00",{"type":16,"children":13094,"toc":13168},[13095],{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":13096,"children":13097},{},[13098,13100,13105,13106,13110,13111,13116,13120,13121,13126,13130,13131,13136,13137,13142,13146,13147,13152,13153,13157,13158,13163,13167],{"type":24,"value":13099},"Psychology! Yes indeed. If you look into the how social media marketing is\ndone than you will find out that every industry and business has same tool and\nsame opportunity. But due to the difference in how consumers interact with the\nbusiness, the nature of strategies differs in social media. For example,\ninteracting with people in Indonesia could completely differ from that in\nIndia. So it boils down to the trend in what affects consumers in large\nextent. So comes the theory of Psychology. If you can understand the\npsychology of consumer than you can surely interact with people in social\nmedia and gain their attention. As a result, its very imminent that people who\nhave cracked this secret in social media are doing great things. Therefore, my\nstatement that Social Media is Psychology makes a lot more sense. bexdeep\n",{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13101,"children":13103},{"href":5681,"rel":13102},[45],[13104],{"type":24,"value":5681},{"type":24,"value":4242},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13107,"children":13108},{"href":5687},[13109],{"type":24,"value":5690},{"type":24,"value":5812},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13112,"children":13114},{"href":5681,"rel":13113},[45],[13115],{"type":24,"value":5681},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13117,"children":13118},{"href":5687},[13119],{"type":24,"value":5690},{"type":24,"value":5823},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13122,"children":13124},{"href":5681,"rel":13123},[45],[13125],{"type":24,"value":5681},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13127,"children":13128},{"href":5687},[13129],{"type":24,"value":5690},{"type":24,"value":5834},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13132,"children":13134},{"href":3463,"rel":13133},[45],[13135],{"type":24,"value":3463},{"type":24,"value":5841},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13138,"children":13140},{"href":5681,"rel":13139},[45],[13141],{"type":24,"value":5681},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13143,"children":13144},{"href":5687},[13145],{"type":24,"value":5690},{"type":24,"value":5852},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13148,"children":13150},{"href":5681,"rel":13149},[45],[13151],{"type":24,"value":5681},{"type":24,"value":4242},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13154,"children":13155},{"href":5687},[13156],{"type":24,"value":5690},{"type":24,"value":5864},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13159,"children":13161},{"href":5681,"rel":13160},[45],[13162],{"type":24,"value":5681},{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13164,"children":13165},{"href":5687},[13166],{"type":24,"value":5690},{"type":24,"value":5692},{"title":8,"searchDepth":51,"depth":51,"links":13169},[],"content:blog:social-media-is-psychology.md","blog/social-media-is-psychology.md","blog/social-media-is-psychology",{"_path":13174,"_dir":6,"_draft":7,"_partial":7,"_locale":8,"title":13175,"description":8,"postId":13176,"slug":13177,"publishedDate":13178,"layout":14,"body":13179,"_type":53,"_id":13233,"_source":55,"_file":13234,"_stem":13235,"_extension":58},"/blog/social-theory-in-online-community","Social Theory in Online Community","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8061911113731935185.post-8980374197159029704","social-theory-in-online-community","2008-12-01T20:27:00.000-08:00",{"type":16,"children":13180,"toc":13231},[13181,13193,13198,13212,13217],{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":13182,"children":13183},{},[13184],{"type":19,"tag":41,"props":13185,"children":13188},{"href":13186,"rel":13187},"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UYUaEitRq54/STS94T9entI/AAAAAAAAAd4/8J5qTkTxdjs/s1600-h/Matrix1.jpg",[45],[13189],{"type":19,"tag":76,"props":13190,"children":13192},{"alt":8,"src":13191},"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UYUaEitRq54/STS94T9entI/AAAAAAAAAd4/8J5qTkTxdjs/s400/Matrix1.jpg",[],{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":13194,"children":13195},{},[13196],{"type":24,"value":13197},"Add as a friend, Join the group, Please Donate, Join a cause, Find a Date.\nYes, all the things that you can do in the online social network.

For a long\ntime, I have heard of the importance of scripting in movie industry and\nimportance of planning a project. But what does this plan contain is not being\nshared by anyone. I think it is something that you learn as you move ahead.\nFor more than 2 years in InRev, I have been involved in many projects and have\nseen first hand what goes wrong in product development. Its the basic lack of\nvision and planning. No one knows what must be done. So what is scripting.\nWell, I have noticed that even in a simple works like creating an animation or\nmaking an presentation, you need plans. Because a lot of time is spending in\ndoing things, so guideline is very important. Scripting doesn#39;t have to\nfollow any rules or format. I think its a simple presentation of any idea on a\nsimple pieces of paper which you need to sell to others. Ideas sell, isn#39;t\nit. I think script is like a short story which you read and see if you like it\nor not. In that short story you need to capture the essence of project. So I\nam going to try today to do something like that for a small presentation that\nI am planning to make. Lets see how it goes. bexdeep\nhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794 noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-1999520473705109254\n2011-01-28T13:58:00.000-08:00 2011-01-28T13:53:03.050-08:00 Feature discovery\nin product design Many designers believe that usability is a key point in\nproduct design. So natural interaction is given high priority. Conforming that\nuser will be able to interact with the product. On the other hand, I feel that\ndiscovering how to operate is also an important, as much as easy to understand\nthe product. Because we human beings are experimental in nature and have been\nlearning by doing things and figuring out the way. But I don#39;t mean to\nstress that the process has to be complicated. bexdeep\nhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794 noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-1702508697747032111\n2011-01-28T11:50:00.001-08:00 2011-01-28T11:50:08.422-08:00 Social Media is\nPsychology Psychology! Yes indeed. If you look into the how social media\nmarketing is done than you will find out that every industry and business has\nsame tool and same opportunity. But due to the difference in how consumers\ninteract with the business, the nature of strategies differs in social media.\nFor example, interacting with people in Indonesia could completely differ from\nthat in India. So it boils down to the trend in what affects consumers in\nlarge extent. So comes the theory of Psychology. If you can understand the\npsychology of consumer than you can surely interact with people in social\nmedia and gain their attention. As a result, its very imminent that people who\nhave cracked this secret in social media are doing great things. Therefore, my\nstatement that Social Media is Psychology makes a lot more sense. bexdeep\nhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794 noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-225346282737123260\n2011-01-19T19:20:00.001-08:00 2011-01-19T19:21:24.076-08:00 Consumer Economy\nFree Information has given opportunity for consumers to be producers and give\nrise to different kind of economy.

I call it quot;The Fabric of\nEconomyquot;. Its a basic concept that every human being should have equal\neconomic opportunity in their life. Hence anyone that tries to distort the\nfabric of economy should be penalized. At the core of economy is the\nquot;informationquot;. The free availability of information ensures stability\nin the economy, as far as I am concern. But there are ways in which\ninformation matters. Each kind of their information has their own priority and\neffect on the global economy. What is more important is the stability of the\neconomy and opportunity rather than arguing the openness of the information.\nbexdeep https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-9062474247128492938\n2011-01-18T04:57:00.001-08:00 2011-01-18T05:07:07.071-08:00 Comic Style\nPresentation with Space Conscious There are lots of technique in which comics\nare being produced and made. The traditional printed comics contains the\nregular flow of the screen-shots of the story. But once I had seen a video on\nTED where the comic creator was talking about the concept of spatial in comics\nand how the internet could revolutionize the comic. I think it will take time\nfor such concept to be widely accepted. As I was going throughnbsp;\nhttp://scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/index.html, it occurred to me that the\nslide presentation can be used to create a pseudo space where the story can be\npresented. It will depend upon the the use of arrow keys like Up, Down, Front\nand Back. But lets see how it goes. The idea is to control the space of the\nstory through the arrow keys. When you press Front, the space will move front\nand when you click Back, the space will move back. Lets see how it will go.\nbexdeep https://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-4387828399064703641\n2010-12-30T00:26:00.001-08:00 2010-12-30T00:26:32.578-08:00 Two levels of\nsocial monitoring Inception of the Idea Ok.
