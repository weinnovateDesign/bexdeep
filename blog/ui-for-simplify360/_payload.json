For a long\ntime, I have heard of the importance of scripting in movie industry and\nimportance of planning a project. But what does this plan contain is not being\nshared by anyone. I think it is something that you learn as you move ahead.\nFor more than 2 years in InRev, I have been involved in many projects and have\nseen first hand what goes wrong in product development. Its the basic lack of\nvision and planning. No one knows what must be done. So what is scripting.\nWell, I have noticed that even in a simple works like creating an animation or\nmaking an presentation, you need plans. Because a lot of time is spending in\ndoing things, so guideline is very important. Scripting doesn#39;t have to\nfollow any rules or format. I think its a simple presentation of any idea on a\nsimple pieces of paper which you need to sell to others. Ideas sell, isn#39;t\nit. I think script is like a short story which you read and see if you like it\nor not. In that short story you need to capture the essence of project. So I\nam going to try today to do something like that for a small presentation that\nI am planning to make. Lets see how it goes. bexdeep\nhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794 noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-1999520473705109254\n2011-01-28T13:58:00.000-08:00 2011-01-28T13:53:03.050-08:00 Feature discovery\nin product design Many designers believe that usability is a key point in\nproduct design.

Yes indeed. If you look into the how social media\nmarketing is done than you will find out that every industry and business has\nsame tool and same opportunity. But due to the difference in how consumers\ninteract with the business, the nature of strategies differs in social media.\nFor example, interacting with people in Indonesia could completely differ from\nthat in India. So it boils down to the trend in what affects consumers in\nlarge extent. So comes the theory of Psychology. If you can understand the\npsychology of consumer than you can surely interact with people in social\nmedia and gain their attention. As a result, its very imminent that people who\nhave cracked this secret in social media are doing great things. Therefore, my\nstatement that Social Media is Psychology makes a lot more sense. bexdeep\nhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/16426541200154503794 noreply@blogger.com 0\ntag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5220667602594297892.post-225346282737123260\n2011-01-19T19:20:00.001-08:00 2011-01-19T19:21:24.076-08:00 Consumer Economy\nFree Information has given opportunity for consumers to be producers and give\nrise to different kind of economy.

I call it quot;The Fabric of\nEconomyquot;. Its a basic concept that every human being should have equal\neconomic opportunity in their life. Hence anyone that tries to distort the\nfabric of economy should be penalized. At the core of economy is the\nquot;informationquot;. The free availability of information ensures stability\nin the economy, as far as I am concern. But there are ways in which\ninformation matters. Each kind of their information has their own priority and\neffect on the global economy.
