You just have to figure out by playing it and\nthat’s it. May be its ignorance within me that prompted me to go this way, but\nI could not go any way either. Honestly, I had no idea of what\nentrepreneurship or leadership is all about, until I started playing the game,\nthe only game which made sense for me to play.
