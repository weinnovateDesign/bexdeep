Have you ever tried writing a Novel? You should because it\nwill teach you to think from different perspective. I had written one when I\nwas in college, and it took me more than a year to complete the story. I was\ntrying to narrate a story around an adventurous journey which I and my good\nfriends had undertaken. It was easy, in a sense that I was aware of the story\nand had some knowledge about the characters that I was trying to describe. But\nwithin those time period, I went through lots of ups and downs which were\naffecting my story line and my characters. This was happening unknowingly and\nI seemed to have no control over it.","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8061911113731935185.post-8330038044355565454","building-a-business-is-like-writing-a-novel","2011-03-17T12:21:00.000-07:00","post",{"type":15,"children":16,"toc":87},"root",[17,24,38,43,48,53,58,63,68,73],{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":20,"children":21},"element","p",{},[22],{"type":23,"value":9},"text",{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":25,"children":26},{},[27],{"type":18,"tag":28,"props":29,"children":33},"a",{"href":30,"rel":31},"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QZZXM8ccfXs/S8lx2D9n4qI/AAAAAAAAA8c/jxjVwnqolLM/s320/writer.jpg",[32],"nofollow",[34],{"type":18,"tag":35,"props":36,"children":37},"img",{"alt":7,"src":30},[],{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":39,"children":40},{},[41],{"type":23,"value":42},"While writing and describing one character I would unknowingly portray the\ncharacter as something else I had no clue of.
