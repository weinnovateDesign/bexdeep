Its been some time, where I have been pondering upon what to\nwrite about. Should I use some marketing brains to choose a perfect topic and\njust throw it in or just be me.

This demonstrates how expressive humans are, it also explains so\nmany facial expressions that we can give. Also, its a great way to start a\nconversation.
