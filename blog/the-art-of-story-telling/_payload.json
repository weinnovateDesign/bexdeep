His name is Hayao Miyazaki, a Japanese animator who have\nproduced one of the most fascinating series of animations, but more properly I\nwould tell he is one of the best story teller that I was seen.",{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":57,"children":58},{},[59],{"type":27,"value":60},"His animations are not just figures and shapes moving but a manifestation of a\nstory which is larger than life.

The\nexperience it set was unquestionable. There was nothing in the movie which\nsounded cheap or pretentious. You could easily notice the thoughtfulness and\nthe passion gone into making the movie. After that I started watching his more\nmovies. Till date, I found that he has made nine movies and after having\nwatched all of that, it got me into thinking that there is a place for soulful\nmovies and stories and not all the world is full of crap :)). Yupe you can\nfind lots of movie making business out of selling their soul in the movie for\nthe sake of viewers. But once in  a while, a good movie, a good story, a good\nbook fills you heart with love for the life like nothing else.",{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":67,"children":68},{},[69,70,76,78,84],{"type":27,"value":32},{"type":18,"tag":34,"props":71,"children":74},{"href":72,"rel":73},"http://www.miyazaki-film.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/merveilleux-",[38],[75],{"type":27,"value":72},{"type":27,"value":77},"\nhayao-miyazaki1.jpg)](",{"type":18,"tag":34,"props":79,"children":82},{"href":80,"rel":81},"http://www.miyazaki-film.com/wp-",[38],[83],{"type":27,"value":80},{"type":27,"value":85},"\ncontent/uploads/2009/05/merveilleux-hayao-miyazaki1.jpg)",{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":87,"children":88},{},[89],{"type":27,"value":90},"So what is so important about the story telling which is unique? I think its\nthe love for life, if you see all the movies of Miyazaki, you won't fail to\nnotice the passion to life, he brings to his stories.
