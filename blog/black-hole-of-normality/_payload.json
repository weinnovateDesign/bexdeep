And\nyes, I mean to literally succumb. Its a poor dilemma of human beings but I\nthink only few can break it. The pull of normality is so strong its\nunavoidable. But I have no offense to it. I think moving towards the normality\nis the nature of human beings and only few have enough strength to go against\nit.
