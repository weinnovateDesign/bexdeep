Why? Let me come to my point,\nwhy is the concept that majority wins followed everywhere. Where in the\nstatistic does it tell that the majority is always the correct. According to\nmathematics, majority only shows the likeliness of the people to choose that\nparticular person. But nowhere does it say that it is the correct one.","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8061911113731935185.post-1493136958911565219","democratic-voting-a-failed-system","2008-12-07T11:25:00.001-08:00","post",{"type":15,"children":16,"toc":54},"root",[17,24,29,34,39,44,49],{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":20,"children":21},"element","p",{},[22],{"type":23,"value":9},"text",{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":25,"children":26},{},[27],{"type":23,"value":28},"Therefore, should majority be followed even if it is known that the choice is\nWRONG.
