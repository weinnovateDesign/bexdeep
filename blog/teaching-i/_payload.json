But it did not\nhappen the way it usually does. Mostly, preparing a lecture would mean holding\na pen and paper and listing the points to be taught. It might sound stupid and\nodd but my most lectures were prepared on my mind. I usually prepared my\nclass, as I was cycling to campus, or sometime while listening to music and\nmost of the time while day dreaming. It is really odd thing to say but it was\nusually this way, that I learnt to teach.

Most of the\ntime, student rarely made their own notes which terribly upset me, for the\nonly reason that they were missing the skills to write down what they knew and\nthat they were being incapable of sharing their knowledge.
